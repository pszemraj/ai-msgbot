person beta:
oh, hello! sorry about that. i'm just calling to say that we've received your new corporate credit card from hq.

person alpha:
that was quick! i wasn't expecting it until later this week.

person beta:
yes, our application procedures have speeded up since we started using the new fast-track system.

person alpha:
shall i come in and collect it?

person beta:
or we can send it to you. but if you would like to use it at the atm, you'll need to wait for your pin number.

person alpha:
mmmm... if i come in and collect it this afternoon, is there any way i could use it today? petty cash is getting low, so i need to draw some money.

person beta:
as long as you bring your id, etc, we can serve you over the counter. but you won't be able to use the atm until your new pin number arrives.

person alpha:
i see. yes, that's fine. i'll be there at around 2:30 pm. see you later, and thanks.

person beta:
what qualifications should a reporter have?

person alpha:
i think i've got used to work under pressure. i will adjust myself to the step of your newspaper quickly.

person beta:
hi, good morning, miss? what can i help you with?

person alpha:
good morning i'd like to mail this box of books to taiwan.

person beta:
ok, please put it on this scale.airmail or by sea?

person alpha:
how long does it take to reach taiwan by sea?

person beta:
usually about two month.

person alpha:
that's too long.how long does it take to reach taiwan by airmail?

person beta:
about ten days.

person alpha:
then how much is that by airmail?

person beta:
let me see.it's 57 dollars, 20 cents, including tax.

person alpha:
that's a little bit expensive.

person beta:
although it's expensive to send it by airmail, it's quicker and safer than by sea.

person alpha:
i guess i have to send it by airmail.

person beta:
do you want to ensure the contents, miss?

person alpha:
yes, please.

person beta:
please fill out this form, also please write the value of the items in this space.

person alpha:

person beta:

person alpha:
of course. go straight ahead. turn right at the next street. you'll see a tall, yellow building.the post office is on the first floor.

person beta:
do you mean that i go that way for one block, then turn right?

person alpha:
yes, you are right.

person beta:
is it far?

person alpha:
no, it's only about five minutes'walk.

person beta:
thank you very much.

person alpha:
it's my pleasure.

person beta:
could you give me some advice on how to bring up my son properly?

person alpha:
he's a bright boy, isn't he?

person beta:
but he always wimps out of difficulty.

person alpha:
don't worry, he'll make good progress step by step.

person beta:
i'm in 507. i have a few problems with my room.

person alpha:
what is that problem, sir?

person beta:
there are cockroaches in my room.

person alpha:
are you sure, sir? flies i could believe, but cockroaches?

person beta:
i've counted nine different cockroaches, and i accidentally stepped on another one.

person alpha:
sir, we run a spotless and cockroach-less hotel.

person beta:
you dare to doubt me?

person alpha:
i'm sorry, sir. let me transfer you to my supervisor.

person beta:
excuse me, sir, i'm afraid you can't park your car here.

person alpha:
why not? it's my parking space.

person beta:
i'm afraid not, sir.

person alpha:
oh? that's a surprise. let me see... d 0411 our dog's birthday. yes, i'm sure this my parking space!

person beta:
but i saw a red car always parking here before.

person alpha:
oh, we've just repainted our car. it was red.

person beta:
maybe. but the car of this space has a broken rearview mirror on the left.

person alpha:
yeah. it used to. we got that fixed yesterday too.

person beta:
could you wait for a minute, sir? i'd like to have a check.

person alpha:
sure, go ahead.

person beta:
sorry, sir, my mistake. this is your parking space.

person alpha:
that's all right. it's not your fault.

person beta:
what can i do for you today?

person alpha:
i need to buy a new refrigerator today.

person beta:
were you looking at a particular refrigerator?

person alpha:
i like that kenmore refrigerator.

person beta:
this particular refrigerator is a very good choice.

person alpha:
tell me about it.

person beta:
not only is it affordable, but it comes with all the appliances.

person alpha:
what are the appliances.

person beta:
it has an ice maker, water dispenser, and plenty of room on the inside.

person alpha:
i'd like to see it for myself.

person beta:
go right ahead.

person alpha:
i like what i see.

person beta:
oh, well. it was fun to be the winner. but... it's too big. i must be an extra small in the states.

person alpha:
so what about the tennis racket?

person beta:
look! it's amazing. i can't wait to try it out!

person alpha:
how much did that end up costing you?

person beta:
oh... around twenty bucks. a bargain if you ask me. look at the picture of her playing with it!

person alpha:
hey, two for one. that's a super deal.

person beta:
and here's her signature!

person alpha:
can i help you?

person beta:
i'm looking for someone who works here, but i lost his business card. his name's long or sang or something like that.

person alpha:
chang?

person beta:
yeah, that sounds right.

person alpha:
there are about twenty people named chang who work here. what department?

person beta:
let me think... accounting, finance, something like that.

person alpha:
eric chang in accounting?

person beta:
that's him!

person alpha:
i'll call him and tell him you're here.

person beta:
i appreciate your help.

person alpha:
would you like to have a seat over there? it'll just be a minute. and can i have your name?

person beta:
here's my card.

person alpha:
ok. i'll have him come up to get you.

person beta:
hello, sir. you're here to discuss the network settlement service, right?

person alpha:
yes, that's right. we want as much info as possible before we agree to anything.

person beta:
yes, it's important to be all clued up before you enter into any agreement. to make full use of the network settlement service and take advantage of the whole banking system, we provide internal fund transfers, account inquiry, agency clearing to name but a few.

person alpha:
so, do you think our corporation will be eligible for this?

person beta:
yes, and it's extremely simple. all you need to do is make a network settlement agreement with us.

person alpha:
dear, time is up, let's go there now.

person beta:
just a minute. i'm putting on my clothes.

person alpha:
have you taken the key to the door?

person beta:
yes. oh, dear, i can't find my hairbrushes. can you help me?

person alpha:
where have you put it?

person beta:
i put it in the dressing room.

person alpha:
are you sure?

person beta:
yes, quite sure.

person alpha:
then, have you looked downstairs?

person beta:
yes, i've looked everywhere downstairs.

person alpha:
look, dear. it's over there.

person beta:
where?

person alpha:
on the floor.

person beta:
excuse me, sir. you can't park here.

person alpha:
i am just waiting for my friends. it won't be long.

person beta:
sir, the curb here is not for parking.

person alpha:
but i didn't see the sign, ma'am.

person beta:
there is a sign at the corner of the street. when you turned in here, you should have seen it.

person alpha:
i didn't see it.

person beta:
i am sorry, sir. i have to give you a ticket. you can appeal to the court within 14 days. you will avoid paying the fine if you can prove that you are not at fault.

person alpha:
are you a goal-oriented person?

person beta:
yes, i am. i always make a plan before i do anything.

person alpha:
where do you want to be in 5 years?

person beta:
i don't want to have a specific title. i just want to enjoy what i am doing.

person alpha:
that sounds very reasonable.

person beta:
it's the most important thing to me.

person alpha:
if you are hired, how long do you plan to stay with us?

person beta:
that obviously depends on how things go-- whether i'm suited to the firm and the firm to me.

person alpha:
tell me about some of your recent goals and what you do to achieve them.

person beta:
i want to put my knowledge and experience to use in a challenging position. in order to achieve this goal, i just want to work step by step.

person alpha:
what is your long-range objective?

person beta:
i haven't thought it over at all.

person alpha:
what do you think is the most important thing when looking for a job?

person beta:
i think the most important thing is the interest in the job.

person alpha:
i'd like to open a current account.

person beta:
certainly. may i see your social security and your id, please.

person alpha:
here you are. i wonder how much interest can i earn from a current account.

person beta:
oh, current accounts don't pay out interest.

person alpha:
why is that?

person beta:
it's primarily designed for business transactions. that is, writing checks to pay for bills, buying things and sending money. we won't expect a large amount of deposit in a current account.

person alpha:
i see. how do i draw money for my own use then?

person beta:
good morning, helen.

person alpha:
good morning, steven.

person beta:
so, what's the status of our advertising campaign?

person alpha:
it'll be a national campaign starting next week.

person beta:
what style will the ads be?

person alpha:
i suggest that we focus on slice of life, showing how you can beat the summer heat by biting into a cool ice-cream sandwich.

person beta:
sounds like a good idea. will we have a new slogan?

person alpha:
definitely.

person beta:
i'd like to taste some local dishes. what would you recommend?

person alpha:
that's fine. you must try this dish.

person beta:
could you tell me how this thing is cooked?

person alpha:
it's fish steamed and served with our special sauce.

person beta:
is it good?

person alpha:
sure. it's a most popular dish.

person beta:
i think i'll try it, and give me some green salad together.

person alpha:
we have two dressings for salad. which one would you like?

person beta:
what kind do you have?

person alpha:
we have french and thousand island.

person beta:
make it thousand island.

person alpha:
taxi!

person beta:
where will you go, sir?

person alpha:
friendship hotel.

person beta:
ok, it's not far from here.

person alpha:
i have something important to do, can you fast the speed?

person beta:
sure, i'll try my best. here we are.

person alpha:
how much should i pay you?

person beta:
the reading on the meter is 15 yuan.

person alpha:
here's 20 yuan, keep the change.

person beta:
thank you very much.

person alpha:
mr. johnson's office. cindy speaking.

person beta:
hi, cindy. it's michael kurt. is mr. johnson in?

person alpha:
no, i'm sorry, mr. kurt. he's stepped out for a bit. would you like me to have him call you?

person beta:
yeah, that'll be great. i'm on extension 4283.

person alpha:
hi, mark.

person beta:
hi, bill. i'd like to take the apartment i looked at yesterday.

person alpha:
all right.

person beta:
so, what do we do now?

person alpha:
this is the lease. you should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant. the lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords.

person beta:
okay.( reads the lease) so, according to the lease, i'll deposit one month's rent as a security deposit, and i have to pay the first month's rent in advance. i understand that i'll get the security deposit back when i move out if the apartment does not need any costly repairs.

person alpha:
yes. if you do not damage the apartment, you will get your security deposit back when you move out.

person beta:
can i pay you by check?

person alpha:
sure. a check will be fine.

person beta:
is there a laundry room in the basement?

person alpha:
yes.

person beta:
can i sign the lease right now?

person alpha:
good morning! what can i do for you?

person beta:
i'm thinking of travelling to suzhou in july. could you recommend some tourist programs for that?

person alpha:
with pleasure. we arrange two kinds of tourist programs for suzhou, a six-day tour by train and a five-day flying journey.

person beta:
how much does a six-day tour by train cost?

person alpha:
five hundred yuan.

person beta:
does that include hotels and meals?

person alpha:
oh, yes, and admission tickets for places of interest as well.

person beta:
that sounds reasonable. what about the five-day flying journey? how much is that?

person alpha:
eight hundred and fifty yuan.

person beta:
covering all expenses?

person alpha:
yes. but there is no half fare for children. they must pay full fare.

person beta:
i can't believe you wear jeans to the office! are you trying to lose your job?

person alpha:
of course not. i'm just observing casual day. on fridays, the company doesn't require us to wear formal business attire.

person beta:
wow! nobody told me about that. won't the relaxed dress code damage the company image?

person alpha:
we don't think so. casual days are becoming more common, and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes.

person beta:
i guess it lets people express their individual tastes. but won't some people abuse it?

person alpha:
not really. besides, there is a separate dress code for casual day. people can't just wear whatever they want.

person beta:
it seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity.

person alpha:
believe it or not, it has the opposite effect. employees are actually more productive on casual days.

person beta:
abc company, my name is lucy. how can i help you?

person alpha:
hello, lucy, this is monica. i'm calling for the accountant position. i saw the information about the vacancy on your company's website. is it still available?

person beta:
thank you for your interest. the position is still available. have you already sent your cv to us?

person alpha:
no, not yet. first, i want to check about the availability and see if you could give more information.

person beta:
it is urgent for us to fill this position now and i would like to stress that english is a must because of the international contacts and most likely traveling abroad very soon. if all these is not problem for you, i recommend you to mention these in your cover letter and send it to me directly.

person alpha:
the notification period of my current job is not that long and i'm quite profession to english and i am happy with the traveling abroad as i'm good dealing with the people from other cultures. it makes the whole job even more interesting. i will send my resume to you still this week.

person beta:
can i help you?

person alpha:
yes, do you have any rooms available?

person beta:

person alpha:
no. i need a double and three triples. my family is waiting for me in the car.

person beta:
please fill out this form, sir.

person alpha:
ok... here you are.

person beta:
here are your keys. check out time is noon.

person alpha:
is breakfast included?

person beta:
no.

person alpha:
why didn't you go to school yesterday?

person beta:
i stayed home because i wasn't feeling well.

person alpha:
what was your problem?

person beta:
my stomach was bothering me.

person alpha:
are you feeling any better?

person beta:
i'm still feeling a little sick.

person alpha:
i'm going to the store, would you like any pesto pistol?

person beta:
i'd appreciate that.

person alpha:
excuse me, but please empty your pockets of all the metal things and put them in this tray.

person beta:
including my keys?

person alpha:
yes, and please step over there.

person beta:
all right. what shall i do now?

person alpha:
just open your bags so we can check them. after that you can pick them up right behind that x-ray machine.

person beta:
i've got film in my bag.

person alpha:
that's all right. this machine will not damage the film.

person beta:
that's fine.

person alpha:
can i have your boarding pass? we need to stamp it.

person beta:
sure. here you are.

person alpha:
thank you.

person beta:
am i through now?

person alpha:
yes. here is your boarding pass.

person beta:
thank you and goodbye.

person alpha:
welcome to flash foot, sir.how can i help you?

person beta:
i'd like extra prints made of these photos.

person alpha:
do you have your negatives?

person beta:
yes.here they are. i've marked how many prints i want on each shot.

person alpha:
what size do you want the prints?

person beta:
four by six, except this one. i want a ten by thirteen print of this one.

person alpha:
okay, they'll be ready for you in an hour.

person beta:
is there anything i can do for you?

person alpha:
i'm interested in taking a tour to sydney.

person beta:
well, we have a package tour there.

person alpha:
how much does it cost?

person beta:
$ 600.

person alpha:
does that include the insurance?

person beta:
of course.

person alpha:
hello, mr. wang. i am glad to meet you here at the fair.

person beta:
like wise. take a seat, please. how about a cup of tea?

person alpha:
sure. thank you. it seems your business is prosperous. there are many customers here.

person beta:
yes, it's not too bad. our sales are going up year after year. and we still have a large potential production capacity.

person alpha:
well, what do you think of choosing a commission representative or agent abroad to promote your sales?

person beta:
that's a good idea. so far, we have several agents abroad.

person alpha:
we are willing to be your agent in thailand for hand-held tools. what do you think?

person beta:
that sounds good.

person alpha:
then, what's your usual commission rate for your agents?

person beta:
usually, we give a commission of 4% to our agents.

person alpha:
4% is too low, i think. you see, we have a lot of work to do in sales promotion, such as advertising on radio or tv, printing booklets, leaflets, catalogues and so on. it all costs money, 4% is not enough.

person beta:
don't worry. we'll allow you a higher commission rate if your sales score a substantial increase.

person alpha:
you mean to saya

person beta:
it sounds ok. then how do you pay the commission?

person alpha:
we may deduct the commission from the invoice value directly or remit it to you after payment.

person beta:
all right. if it's okay, we would like to sign an agency agreement with you immediately.

person alpha:
think it over. we hope to keep a good business relationship with you.

person beta:
thank you for your help.

person alpha:
i'm glad these batteries are on sale.

person beta:
i'm sorry. these batteries are not on sale.

person alpha:
but that's what the ad said.

person beta:
i'm sorry. if you look at the ad again, you'll see that the other brand is on sale.

person alpha:
oh. you're right. i misread the ad.

person beta:
yes, many people make that mistake.

person alpha:
well, you can't blame them. it's a confusing ad.

person beta:
you're right. many ads are like that.

person alpha:
well, as long as i'm here.

person beta:
just one second, and i'll give you the batteries that are on sale.

person alpha:
hi, jack, we are having a party tonight, wanna coming enjoy us? you can bring your girlfriend, tina.

person beta:
i don't have a girlfriend. i'm single.

person alpha:
oh, that's right. well, there are going to be many beautiful girls at the party tonight, anyway.

person beta:
no, i like being single. i never thought lonely, i'm focus on my career. maybe i'll start to look for my girl when i achieve success.

person alpha:
why is that?

person beta:
because i'm living a real world, a man enriched have a good career and make a lot of money. franklin speaking the girls i've met wounldn't married a man wounldn't make enough money.

person alpha:
i agree, a man needs good career.but that doesn't mean he should have a little fun, too.

person beta:
so, casey, how are things going with the photos for the press kit?

person alpha:
yeah, i've been meaning to talk to you about that. i might need to ask for an extension on that deadline.

person beta:
you've had over a month to get this finalized! why are things delayed?

person alpha:
well, the thing is, we ran into a lot of problems...

person beta:
i'm not looking for excuses here. i just want to get this finished on time!

person alpha:
i know, and i apologize for the delay. but some things were just beyond my control. i had trouble booking the photographer, and then michael was sick for three weeks, so i couldn't include him in the photos, and the design team lost all the files, so i had to re-do the pictures.

person beta:
i'm not going to put this off any longer, casey! i want those photos asap!

person alpha:
yes, sir?

person beta:
can i have mr. j. smith paged? he said he'd be in the main dining room. i'm mr. j. b. white.

person alpha:
who would you like to have paged again, sir?

person beta:
mr. j. smith.

person alpha:
where would you like him to come?

person beta:
to the front desk.

person alpha:
just a moment, please.

person beta:
can you help me find a lotion for a problem i am having?

person alpha:
that's what i am here for. what questions can i answer for you?

person beta:
i have poison oak, and i need help with the rash that won't stop itching.

person alpha:
the best product is techne, and you can buy either the lotion or cream.

person beta:
which one is best?

person alpha:
the cream form is very popular.

person beta:
can i do anything else to help with the itching?

person alpha:
you could also take an antihistamine to help the rash go away quicker.

person beta:
i appreciate you helping me find a solution to the itching.

person alpha:
anytime you have a question, please feel free to ask.

person beta:
excuse me. something is wrong with my bank card. can you help me?

person alpha:
yes. what's the problem?

person beta:
just a mistake with my name. it should be issued as steven, but the card is under the name'steven'.

person alpha:
oh, i am very sorry about that. it's our fault. i will arrange someone to correct it immediately.

person beta:
ok, no problem. to err is human.

person alpha:
anyway, we apologize for the inconvenience we have brought you. please just wait for a moment, and it will be fixed.

person beta:
thank you very much.

person alpha:
we are doing secret santa at the office again this year.

person beta:
whose name did you pick?

person alpha:
i got jacob. any ideas what to get him?

person beta:
booze!

person alpha:
yeah, you're right. can't go wrong with that.

person beta:
is everything to your satisfaction?

person alpha:
no, the steak was recommended, but it is not very fresh.

person beta:
oh, sorry to hear that. this is quite unusual. i will look into the matter.

person alpha:
this is very annoying.

person beta:
i'm sorry, sir. do you wish to try something else? that would be on the house, of course.

person alpha:
no, i don't risk it.

person beta:
how about a delicious dessert then, with our compliment?

person alpha:
i'm not keen on dessert as a habit. they are fattening.

person beta:
i see, sir. i'm sure everything will be right next time you come.

person alpha:
excuse me, are you jane?

person beta:
no, i'm mary.

person alpha:
oh, are you in class four?

person beta:
no, i'm in class there.

person alpha:
excuse me, but i'm not feeling too well. i think i'm going to throw up.

person beta:
there's an airsickness bag behind the seat that's in front of you.

person alpha:
i must've missed it.

person beta:
is this your first time flying?

person alpha:
yes. i'm going to san francisco.

person beta:
oh, it's a beautiful city. i think you'll like it.

person alpha:
hey, i'm feeling much better already.

person beta:
sometimes if you don't think about it, that sick feeling will go away on its own.

person alpha:
thanks. by the way, my name is mary.

person beta:
i'm frank. nice to meet you.

person alpha:
welcome to al's bakery. what can i get you?

person beta:
hi! let me get a dozen croissants, four blueberry muffins and a loaf of sourdough bread.

person alpha:
sure. would you like to have the loaf sliced?

person beta:
no, that's ok. do you have any whole wheat bread?

person alpha:
we are out at the moment. may i suggest some rye bread?

person beta:
sure that sounds good. do you have any cakes?

person alpha:
we have various birthday cakes and also ice cream cakes.

person beta:
i'll just take a cheesecake.

person alpha:
will that be all?

person beta:
yes.

person alpha:
your total is forty three dollars and twenty cents.

person beta:

well, i can only give him these for now, and after a couple of weeks i can administer the rest.

person alpha:
ok, great. doctor, i think i also may need a tetanus booster. last time i got it was maybe fifteen years ago!

person beta:
we will check our records and i'll have the nurse administer and the booster as well. now, please hold ricky's arm tight, this may sting a little.

person alpha:
i'm interested in teaching at your school.

person beta:
great. are you a qualified teacher?

person alpha:
yes.

person beta:
what kind of teaching certificate do you have?

person alpha:
i have a tefl certificate.

person beta:
how many years of experience do you have?

person alpha:
i have three years of teaching esl and four years of teaching per-school children.

person beta:
when did you get your tefl certificate?

person alpha:
i got my tefl certificate three years ago.

person beta:
why do you want to teach at our school?

person alpha:
well, i've heard many good things about it. i also like teaching young children.

person beta:
that's great. can you speak chinese?

person alpha:
yes, just a little.

person beta:
can you come in for an interview tomorrow at 10:00?

person alpha:
i sure can.

person beta:
great. see you then.

person alpha:
why is the car before us stopping?

person beta:
what's going on?

person alpha:
look. two cars are standing right in the middle of the road and the drivers are shouting rude words to each other. that's why that car stops.

person beta:
more and more people easily get irritated while driving.

person alpha:
yes. this is what is called road rage.

person beta:
this is today's schedule. at 8 thirty am, conference with the department managers. at 9 o'clock, live for the workshop where you'll award prizes to the staff for preventatives.

person alpha:
that's great. what are the prizes?

person beta:
3000 rib as bonus for each person.

person alpha:
to encourage the staff increases.

person beta:
ok. next thing is laying the corner-stone for the new plant at 10 am. at 12 am, back here for lunch.

person alpha:
what about the afternoon?

person beta:
at 2 pm, give a presentation here with the press. at four o'clock sharp, have dinner with mr. smith, manager of ncc.

person alpha:
this is lincoln bank, consumer credit department. how can i help you?

person beta:
ah, hello. i'm calling to find out how i apply for a car loan.

person alpha:
we offer a personal automobile consumer loan. the application process is pretty straight forward. i trust you have enough funds to cover the 20% down payment?

person beta:
yes, i do. it's ready and waiting in my account.

person alpha:
the next step is for us to recommend a dealer to you, who are already contracted to us, so...

person beta:
could i just stop you there? sorry to interrupt, but i have already been to your appointed dealer and selected the car i want.

person alpha:
that will certainly cut down the processing time. we can move on to the next step. do you have the purchase price?

person beta:
yes, it's 110,000 rib. so, with the down payment done, i will need to borrow 70,000 rib.

person alpha:
what we need you to do next is to come into the branch with a correctly filled in application form, id card, proof of residency, proof of income, the agreement from the agent and of course the 20% down payment.

person beta:
yes, i have everything here. ok, i'll come in and see you later today. maybe i could have my new car as early as next week! how exciting!

person alpha:
hi, my name is tom.

person beta:
tom, the new sales representative? nice to meet you! i'm melinda.

person alpha:
nice to meet you too.melinda.

person beta:
now let me show you around. this is our reception area, and our conference room is right over there. over here is the sales department.

person alpha:
really? this is a nice office, but it's quite small.

person beta:
yeah... you can make photocopies and send faxes over there.

person alpha:
it looks like you guys work hard.

person beta:
i tell you what just between you and me, we just mess things up so that it looks like we work hard.just kidding. oh, your cubicle is over the. and this way. those are all private offices the managers offices.

person alpha:
hmm... tell me more details about our jobs.

person beta:
sure thing.

person alpha:
what do you think of our price?

person beta:
your price has gone up sharply, hasn't it?

person alpha:
yes. we regret we cannot maintain our original price. since the prices of the raw materials have been raised, we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly.

person beta:
i agree with you there, but your price is unreasonable.

person alpha:
i don't think so. you must compare our price with that of other export houses. i'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level.

person beta:
i don't think we'll be able to pay the price. to have this business concluded, you need to lower your price at least by 3%.

person alpha:
i'm afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price.

person beta:
don't you agree with me that in the long run, moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit?

person alpha:
we've already cut down our price to cost level.

person beta:
is that all?

person alpha:
yes, this is the best we can do.

person beta:
i'm sorry we can't handle the price you offered.

person alpha:
so, jimmy, how does it feel to have your own money?

person beta:
it's great, dad. i don't mind delivering papers, but the real fun is collecting the money.

person alpha:
even though you are only twelve, it's not too early to start saving a little money.

person beta:
i've never had a bank account before. why don't i just keep my money under the matters like grandpa does?

person alpha:
you know you would spend it. and also, money in the bank earns interest.

person beta:
but what if i need my money suddenly?

person alpha:
the bank will give you a pin, and you can withdraw money from any atm.

person beta:
great! so it's almost the same as keeping it under the matters!

person alpha:
not quite. you have to maintain a minimum balance of twenty dollars. and sometimes the bank has service charges. but you don't have to worry about that yet. let's go make your first depot

person beta:
ok. guess i have to do that before. i can make money my first withdrawal.

person alpha:
is this where i can catch a bus to the theater?

person beta:
yes, but you can't get there with out a change.

person alpha:
which bus do i have to change?

person beta:
you have to get off at the hospital and change for bus 15.

person alpha:
i see. thank you.

person beta:
here we are, joan. this is the palace museum, also known as the forbidden city.

person alpha:
oh, how splendid! can you take a picture of me here?

person beta:
sure.

person alpha:
excuse me. i'm afraid i got lost. where am i on this map?

person beta:
we are here, bus station, we are in the heart of the city.

person alpha:
oh! can i go from here to the zhongshan park?

person beta:
head straight up the street about two blocks then turn right.

person alpha:
tony, could you tell me if there are any special rules about the job?

person beta:
working hours are from 8: 30 a. m. to 5:00 p. m. be sure not to be late or absent. report to the manager by filling in the'monthly report'every month.

person alpha:
is there anything else? how about my salary?

person beta:
our company has a strict and reasonable salary standard. on the 20th day of every month, you can get your salary on time. benefits depend upon the length of service and the employee's past attendance record.

person alpha:
wow, thank you for telling me these. do you mind telling me something else, like attendance record, holiday, and how to ask for leave?

person beta:
all new members are likely to ask the same questions. haha. i can understand that. every month you have three days off, besides the weekends and some important holidays. after you've been here for a year, you qualify for a one-week vacation. the leave less than a half-day should predict for an hour, and more than a half-day should predict three days.

person alpha:
okay, that's good. i get it.

person beta:
kate, you never believe what's happened.

person alpha:
what do you mean?

person beta:
masha and hero are getting divorced.

person alpha:
you are kidding. what happened?

person beta:
well, i don't really know, but i heard that they are having a separation for 2 months, and filed for divorce.

person alpha:
that's really surprising. i always thought they are well matched. what about the kids? who get custody?

person beta:
masha, it seems quiet and makable, no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out.

person alpha:
that's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about. well, i still can't believe it, masha and hero, the perfect couple. when would they divorce be final?

person beta:
early in the new year i guess.

person alpha:
overseas operator.

person beta:
i would like to make a collect call to taipei, taiwan, please.

person alpha:
your name, please.

person beta:
tim chen.

person alpha:
what's the number, please.

person beta:
the area code is 2, and the number is 2367-9960.

person alpha:
the line is connected. please go ahead.

person beta:
hello. excuse me.

person alpha:
yes. can i help you?

person beta:
do you remember me? i just had lunch here a half hour ago.

person alpha:
of course i remember you.

person beta:
i think i lost my wallet here.

person alpha:
oh, no. really? i didn't see anything.

person beta:
really? you didn't find a wallet?

person alpha:
no, i didn't. would you like to go look by the table with me?

person beta:
yes, i would. it's not here. and it's not on the floor.has anyone sat at this table since we left?

person alpha:
no. it's been empty the whole time.

person beta:
hmm. i don't know how it could have happened.

person alpha:
i remember, sir, that your friend took the bill.you didn't pay for the lunch yourself, did you?

person beta:
no. my friend did.

person alpha:
then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here?

person beta:
no, i'm not sure. but i usually take out my wallet when i sit down.it's uncomfortable to sit on it. so i usually put it next to me on the table.

person alpha:
maybe you lost it before you came here. or maybe you left it at home.

person beta:
i don't think it's at home. i think i had it when i left the house.but what should i do?

person alpha:
well, the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home.then, if it isn't, you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards. next, you need to replace whatever you lost, your driver's license, things like that.

person beta:
should i call the police?

person alpha:
you can if you want. but the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets.

person beta:
hmm. i'll go home and check. maybe you're right. maybe it's at home.

person alpha:
i'm sorry we couldn't find it, sir.

person beta:
thanks for your help.

person alpha:
good morning, young lady. you can call me ma. do you see anything you like?

person beta:
yes. many things! i especially love this beautiful quilt.

person alpha:
that quilt was passed down to me from my ma in holland.

person beta:
it sounds like a special quilt. why do you want to sell it?

person alpha:
well, this home is too big for me now, so i'm moving to an apartment that is much smaller. therefore, i need to part with a few things.

person beta:
oh, i see. umm, how much do you want for the quilt?

person alpha:
is fifteen dollars ok?

person beta:
have you got change for a thousand?

person alpha:
let me see.

person beta:
may i come in, mr sun?

person alpha:
i'd rather you didn't, miss yang. i'm very busy now.

person beta:
can i try later then?

person alpha:
yes, of course.

person beta:
is it all right for me to come in now, mr sun?

person alpha:
well, uh... i'm still pretty busy, but... all right. come in. what can i do for you?

person beta:
do you mind if i sit down?

person alpha:
not at all. take a seat. now what can i do for you?

person beta:
i want to leave the department. do you think i could put info a transfer?

person alpha:
yes. but why should you want to do that?

person beta:
do you mind if i speak frankly?

person alpha:
not at all. go ahead.

person beta:
well. you see, i don't like the office. i don't like the staff. and i'm afraid of you. and i don't want to go one. so may i put info a transfer?

person alpha:
yes. i'd be delighted if you did.

person beta:
where is that?

person alpha:
take me to the airport, please.

person beta:
are you in a hurry?

person alpha:
i have to be there before 17 o'clock.

person beta:
we'll make it except a jam. you know it's rush hour.

person alpha:
there's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time.

person beta:
i'll do my best.

person alpha:
here's twenty dollars.

person beta:
do you have small bills?

person alpha:
no. if you can't break it, keep the change. but can you give me a receipt?

person beta:
here is your receipt. thank you.

person alpha:
recently i have been getting headache and my eyes don't seems to see focus properly.

person beta:
when did you last time have your eyes checked?

person alpha:
two years ago. at that time i had no problems.now i can't even make out something ten meters away.

person beta:
come over here. i will test your eyes. first cover your left eye like this, and when i point, please read the chart from the top, and go as far as you can, telling me which way the" e" points.

person alpha:
all right.

person beta:
good.now the other eye.

person alpha:
well, this one is worse.

person beta:
never mind, just read as far as you can.

person alpha:
i can only read the first three lines.

person beta:
is there a car park near the supermarket?

person alpha:
yes, there is an underground car park near the supermarket.

person beta:
i see. thanks.

person alpha:
oh, come on, ultraman!

person beta:
what's up, bro? what's in the bulletin?

person alpha:
it says that there will be a blackout from 5 p. m. to 7 p. m. in our neighborhood today.

person beta:
blackout? even the tv has the limit.

person alpha:
don't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout?

person beta:
oops, no, daddy can't watch american idol, either!

person alpha:
that's not the point. come on, can you imagine that there will be no electricity on such a hot day?

person beta:
oh, my god! no air-conditioner!

person alpha:
ok, since you are the smart one, can you come up with a better plan? so that we won't be baked like cookies here.

person beta:
how about playing barbie out there in the neighborhood?

person alpha:
barbie? you know, i might be seven, but i'm not a girl.

person beta:
do you have a better plan?

person alpha:
all right, all right.

person beta:
yes, ma'am, how could i help you?

person alpha:
i am wondering if you do facial care?

person beta:
yes, we do.

person alpha:
how much would it be?

person beta:
from 200 to 800.

person alpha:
i'm afraid 800 is too expensive for me. could you recommend something around 300?

person beta:
no problem.

person alpha:
can i help you, miss?

person beta:
i would like to order 2 office-style cabinets and desk calendars. we want office-style cabinets in white. the catalogue number is 90- f- 2356.

person alpha:
how soon do you want it?

person beta:
could you deliver it tomorrow?

person alpha:
no problem.

person beta:
please handle the items carefully.

person alpha:
certainly.

person beta:
we will pay by collect on delivery.

person alpha:
i hate to do this to you, alice, but i'm going to have to ask you to put in some more overtime.

person beta:
does it have to be this afternoon, mr. fairbanks? i've already made plans.

person alpha:
well, i would have preferred to do it today, but if you've already made plans, we can do it tomorrow.

person beta:
i'd appreciate that, sir. how long do you think you'll need me to stay?

person alpha:
what's your attitude when do wrong things at work?

person beta:
the buck stops here.

person alpha:
hello! is your company advertising for administrative assistant on the newspapers?

person beta:
well, administrative assistant with shorthand and typing skills are badly needed here.

person alpha:
first i want to check about the availability and see if you could give me more information.

person beta:
the position calls for a person with some working experience. we must be able to benefit from your analytical and interpersonal skills. can you deliver your resume to us first?

person alpha:
of course. i will deliver my resume to you in minutes'time. i hope you will consider my application and i shall appreciate a reply at your earliest convenience.

person beta:
ok. i will call you soon. bye now.

person alpha:
bye.

person beta:
just as the saying goes, every potter praises his own pot. you should pay special attention to selling yourself properly in the interview.

person alpha:
it is especially important for the graduates who step into the job market for the first time.

person beta:
you'd better prepare what you are going to say in advance, in order to have a good performance in the interview.

person alpha:
the contents should be mainly descriptions of your background. and the length depends on the particular situation.

person beta:
only when you are aware of what the interviewer will be interested in, can you make a targeted preparation.

person alpha:
to sell yourself successfully, you should leave the interviewer a deep impression.

person beta:
selling yourself should go straight to the point, and the statement should be clear and brief.

person alpha:
it should also be truthful and realistic. do not blindly blow your own horn.

person beta:
you should particularly state your strong points which are closely related to the position you are applying for.

person alpha:
while you should not omit your weak points, they need to be described appropriately

person beta:
time permitted, you could add certain examples to your description.

person alpha:
besides, in the interview, it is best that you make corresponding adjustments to apply your prepared contents flexibly.

person beta:
hello?

person alpha:
hi, deborah! this is john. i'm calling from australia.

person beta:
what are you doing in australia?

person alpha:
i'm attending a conference in sydney this week. remember?

person beta:
oh, right. what time is it there?

person alpha:
it's 10:00 p. m. and it's four o'clock in los angeles, right?

person beta:
yes- four o'clock in the morning.

person alpha:
4:00 a. m.? i'm really sorry.

person beta:
that's ok. i'm awake now.

person alpha:
john hasn't turned up and stefan is ill. do we have anyone on stand-by?

person beta:
i'm afraid not, we're very short-staffed at the moment. can you ask the shift supervisor to ask one of his team to do some overtime? perhaps tommy can stand in for an hour or two until we find a replacement.

person alpha:
jack, let's go!

person beta:
oh, you are out of breath! what happened?

person alpha:
some people are wildly shooting on the next street. we must leave here as soon as possible!

person beta:
take it easy. they will get caught.

person alpha:
hello. may i speak to jerry, please?

person beta:
sorry, but he is out for lunch right now.

person alpha:
i see. can you give me some idea how long he'll be back?

person beta:
i think he will be back around 2:00. if you like, please leave your name and phone number, i'll have him call you as soon as he comes back.

person alpha:
that's nice. my name is steven, my phone number is 6789777. okay, i'll be waiting for his call. thank you and bye!

person beta:
my pleasure, bye!

person alpha:
excuse me, miss.

person beta:
what can i do for you?

person alpha:
i've just heard an announcement that my flight has been delayed.

person beta:
what's your flight number?

person alpha:
flight ca216 to chengdu.

person beta:
yes, it's true. it has been delayed.

person alpha:
could you please tell me why?

person beta:
yes, of course. the delay is due to heavy rain.

person alpha:
how long will the delay be? do you have any further information about it?

person beta:
i am sorry, we don't know the extent of the delay at present. but according to the latest weather forecast, there will be a change in weather soon.

person alpha:
we have to wait. well, is it possible for the rain to stop before noon?

person beta:
it's hard to say. weather is so changeable in the summer. please listen to the latest announcement about your flight.

person alpha:
yes, i will. thanks a lot. bye!

person beta:
bye

person alpha:
what are we going to do? i can't get the car out of this ditch. i'm stuck!

person beta:
i'm worried, tom. i haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour.

person alpha:
i know. this is terrible. what can we do? this snow doesn't stop falling!

person beta:
i told you we should have stayed in town today.the weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.why did you want to come up here?

person alpha:
i wanted to show you the cabin. we only had another half-hour to go.

person beta:
well, now we're stuck. what can we do?

person alpha:
i don't know.

person beta:
i've heard that when this happens, it's important to save energy.

person alpha:
what do you mean?

person beta:
we're stranded here, tom. we may be here a long time.we need to conserve the gas in the car. the car's energy is what will keep us warm.

person alpha:
i have plenty of gas.

person beta:
yes, but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.we can't just let the car run and run.if we do, it will die soon. then we'll freeze.

person alpha:
so what can we do?

person beta:
turn the lights off.then, run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.that will conserve the heat as long as possible.

person alpha:
alright. that's a good idea.

person beta:
i wish we hadn't come up here. now we'll probably be here for days.

person alpha:
days?

person beta:
yes, it happens.that is what happens in big snowstorms. people get stranded for days.

person alpha:
oh, my god! it's good we have food.

person beta:
probably we'll survive.but turn the car off for about forty-five minutes. then we'll turn it on again.

person alpha:
hey, buddy, can't you see there's a line?

person beta:
oh, sorry. i didn't know.

person alpha:
what? you haven't taken the bus before?

person beta:
no, i'm afraid not.

person alpha:
well, you have to wait in line like everyone else. besides, you should let old people on first.

person beta:
sorry.

person alpha:
it's all right. where are you going?

person beta:
i wanted to see the white house.

person alpha:
oh, well you don't want this bus, anyway. it goes to georgetown.

person beta:
oh, no.

person alpha:
it's all right, though. just get off at the next stop and catch the 79a.

person beta:
oh, well thank you very much.

person alpha:
you're welcome.

person beta:
can i help you?

person alpha:
i'd like the double cheese burger meal, please.

person beta:
what kind of drink would you like with that?

person alpha:
just coke will be fine.

person beta:
would you like a super size meal? only 2 rib more, you'll get large coke and fries instead of medium. and today we are offering free toys all the meal boxes.

person alpha:
that sounds good, thanks, i'd like that. actually i'd like sprite instead of coke, thanks.

person beta:
that's not a problem, miss. will that be it?

person alpha:
yes, that's all.

person beta:
that will be 25rmb, please

person alpha:
you got it.

person beta:
do you have any night tours?

person alpha:
yes, we will depart in 10 minutes.

person beta:
is that a guided tour?

person alpha:
yes, it is.

person beta:
that's fine. let's get on the bus.

person alpha:
i am sure we will make it up as soon as possible.

person beta:
that's nice.

person alpha:
we hope this matter will not affect our good relations in our future dealings.

person beta:
of course not. we have cooperated for a long time.

person alpha:
i would like to purchase some meat.

person beta:
what kind of meat would you like to get today?

person alpha:
first off, i'm going to need a pound of ground beef.

person beta:
a pound of ground beef is$ 2.48.

person alpha:
that's perfect.

person beta:
what else will you be needing?

person alpha:
i'm also going to need three pounds of chicken breasts.

person beta:
the chicken breasts cost$ 4.05 per pound.

person alpha:
what's the total price for the chicken?

person beta:
it's going to be$ 12.15.

person alpha:
okay, i think that will be all for me today.

person beta:
i think you know already that i want to discuss the represent- ton for your alarm clocks.

person alpha:
yes, mr. bergeron. you mentioned that in your letter. to tell you the truth, your proposal surprised us.

person beta:
is that so? anyhow i want to go over the details with you in person, so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration. our firm specializes in this line of business. we have six sales representatives, who are on the road all the time, covering the whole of the european market.

person alpha:
do you sell direct to shops?

person beta:
yes, we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts. we have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct, without any middlemen.

person alpha:
do you keep a stock of these things?

person beta:
in some cases, such as the wristwatches, which always have a steady market, we keep a stock in london and act as distributors as well as agents. generally, however, we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply. we are paid for our service, of course.

person alpha:
that is, your commission.

person beta:
yes, our commission is very reasonable. we usually get a 10% commission of the amount on every deal.

person alpha:
our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5% commission.

person beta:
the european market is not familiar with your products. you have competitors from japan and other continental countries. at the beginning of our campaign, there is sales resistance to overcome, we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news- papers and tv programs. a 10% commission will not leave us much.

person alpha:
according to your estimate, what is the maximum annual turn- over you can fulfill, in round figures, of course?

person beta:
we will always do our utmost to enlarge the business, as our remuneration increases with the turnover, but we will not guar- ante anything, at least not to begin with.

person alpha:
we appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products. but our suggestion to you, mr. bergeron, as a preliminary step, is to do a little research into the market...

person beta:
do you mean to say you refuse us the agency?

person alpha:
mr. bergeron, you leave us no alternative. we can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole european market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover. besides our price is worked out according to the costing. a 10% commission means an increase in our price. we must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect.

person beta:
oh, that's just too bad. i intended to make great efforts in selling your products.

person alpha:
well, we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement. to start the ball rolling, we will provide you with price lists, catalogues and some samples. only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products, can we then discuss further details.

person beta:
ah, mrs. miller, but in this case am i covered?

person alpha:
oh, yes. we will give you a 5% commission on every transaction.

person beta:

person beta:

person alpha:

person beta:

person alpha:
all these products are our best-selling lines. the prices of our products will change according to that of the international market demand. and we are always open to negotiate, especially on larger orders. what do you have in mind?

person beta:
how long does your offer remain valid? i need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan.

person alpha:
i understand. our offer remains open for 4 days.

person beta:
hello sir, may i help you?

person alpha:
yeah, i accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet.

person beta:
i see. well, you have come to the right place. we have over one hundred models of more than twenty leading mobile phone manufacturers.

person alpha:
sounds good. i don't want it to be too expensive, maybe something mid-range.

person beta:
we have this new etc smart phone.it comes with the android os so you can download applications. it also has a built-in camera, mp3 player and touch screen. it works on the 3g network so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are.

person alpha:
what about wi-fi?

person beta:
of course! you can access the internet from any hotspot as well as from home.

person alpha:
one last thing. is it waterproof?

person beta:
we have been over this a hundred times! we are not getting a pet!

person alpha:
why not? come on! just a cute little puppy or a kitty!

person beta:
who is going to look after a dog or a cat?

person alpha:
i will! i'll feed it, bathe it and walk it every day! we can get a labrador or a german shepard!

person beta:
what if we want to take a vacation? who will we leave it with? plus, our apartment is too small for that breed of dog.

person alpha:
ok. how about we get a cat or a ferret?

person beta:
we're planning on having children soon, i don't think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house.

person alpha:
fine! let's get a bird then! we can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk! a parrot would be awesome!

person beta:
i'll tell you what, i can get you some hamsters and we'll take it from there.

person alpha:
yay!

person beta:
good evening, mr. lee and thank you for choosing our airline. we have just discovered that this flight is overbooked. would you like to volunteer to give up your seat?

person alpha:
overbooked? give up my seat? i don't understand.

person beta:
from time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft. that's overbooked.

person alpha:
i know what overbooked is, i just don't understand how that could happen?

person beta:
actually it's a common practice to overbook, as passengers often don't take their flight as scheduled. most of the time there is no problem but today, more passengers arrived than we have seats,

person alpha:
so who has to stay behind?

person beta:
well, first we ask for volunteers. if someone like yourself volunteers, they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year. if no one volunteers we just have to select someone.

person alpha:
ok. i'll volunteer. i could use a free ticket!

person beta:
i want to rent this apartment.

person alpha:
i'm glad to hear that.

person beta:
how much are you asking?

person alpha:
you will have to pay$ 1050 every month.

person beta:
i can't afford that.

person alpha:
what can you afford?

person beta:
i was thinking$ 800 a month.

person alpha:
i'll need you to pay more than that.

person beta:
how much more?

person alpha:
how does$ 900 every month sound to you?

person beta:
i can live with that.

person alpha:
we have a deal then.

person alpha:
it's about a ten-minute walk.

person beta:
that's very clear. i think i can find my way now. thank you.

person alpha:
not at all.

person beta:
how does the political system work in your country?

person alpha:
we have hundreds of constituencies and the voters in each one elect a member of parliament. most people call them mp's.

person beta:
each mp belongs to a political party, right?

person alpha:
almost all of them do. a few are independent. that means that they do not belong to a party. if one party more than half of the mp's. they form a government. that means that they choose a prime finist

person beta:
what's a cabinet?

person alpha:
this is a small group of people-perhaps 25 mp's who are usually ministers. they make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy.

person beta:
can any mp make a law?

person alpha:
any mp can present a law to parliament. the proposed law is debated and voted on. if it is accepted, it becomes law.

person beta:
i suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties.

person alpha:
yes, it does, because they have most of the mp's. most mp's vote the way their party wants them to.

person beta:
how do people choose which party or candidate to vote for?

person alpha:
they produce manifesto. these documents which states their policies. some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election. voters who often change the party they vote for are calle

person beta:
how was your interview?

person alpha:
pretty good. the hr manager asked me the usual questions. then he wondered why i had decided to leave my previous job.

person beta:
what did you say?

person alpha:
i told him that i hadn't got a raise for three years. i also told him that one of my best co-workers quitted her job because she had not been promoted for eight years.

person beta:
did he want to know the reasons?

person alpha:
yes. i told him that my boss made some excuses of the recession. but i thought he had a pattern and a record of promoting men only.

person beta:
that's sex discrimination. when will you get the reply?

person alpha:
in a couple of days, i was told.

person beta:
wish you good luck!

person alpha:
thank you.

person beta:

person beta:
i need souvenirs!

person alpha:
you want some souvenirs!

person beta:
yes, yes. souvenirs.

person alpha:
but, sir, our souvenir shop carries all those items.

person beta:
that's not the same thing. if you buy hotel souvenirs, they have no sentimental value.

person alpha:
i understand, sir. i'll call housekeeping. you'll have your souvenirs shortly.

person beta:
hello, may i help you?

person alpha:
yes.we're interested in seeing the rooms for rent.

a nice quiet house is exactly what we're looking for.

well, gentleman.each room is$ 40 a week if you think that's ok.

person alpha:
that sounds just wonderful to us.

person beta:
when do you want to move in?

person alpha:
how about this afternoon?

person beta:
fine. i'll be expecting you around two.

person alpha:
are you ready to order? may i suggest a veal?

person beta:
no, i'll have the fish please.

person alpha:
the chicken is also nice.

person beta:
no, i want the fish.

person alpha:
our special tonight is lobster.

person beta:
thank you, but i prefer the fish.

person alpha:
perhaps you'd enjoy the lamb.

person beta:
no, i like the fish.

person alpha:
what ever you say?

person beta:
am i ever hungry? when will supper be ready?

person alpha:
it's almost ready. can you set the table?

person beta:
all right.

person alpha:

person beta:
yeah. oh, it's delicious!

person alpha:
really?

person beta:
definitely. it's a wonderful meal. thank you, honey.

person alpha:
if you like to help me do the dishes, i'll be more dreadful.

person beta:
i wish i could, but i won't.

person alpha:
good morning, kate. long time no see.

person beta:
good morning, vera, nice to meet you.

person alpha:
kate, i know you've been a stewardess for more than one year. and i'll have an interview on stewardess tomorrow. can you tell me some etiquette about the interview?

person beta:
of course. first you should do up your long hair and do make up but not too thick.

person alpha:
is there anything else i should pay attention to?

person beta:
yes, when you attend the interview, you should pay attention to your manner, style of conversation and expression. you should keep smiling always, being polite when you talk with the interviewer. don't move from time to time when you sit there. and you also should know how to use eye contact.

person alpha:
thank you, i've learned so much from you.

person beta:
that's all right. hope you can do better tomorrow.

person alpha:
can you fix me a cup of tea, johnny?

person beta:
well... uh... how about a glass of juice instead?

person alpha:
no. i'd like tea. can you put it in my favorite cup? you probably washed it...

person beta:
oh, yeah. well, uh, about your mug...

person alpha:
i'll find it... where are all the floral pattern plates? and dad's yankee's mug?

person beta:
good morning, sir. may i help you?

person alpha:
yes, i'd like to settle my bill.

person beta:
certainly sir. may i have your room key, please?

person alpha:
sure. here you are.

person beta:
just a moment, please. i'll draw up your bill for you... thank you for waiting, sir. your bill totals two thousand six hundred and fifty-eight yuan, including the phone and laundry.

person alpha:
that much! would you mind letting me have a look at it?

person beta:
not at all, sir. here you are.

person alpha:
thanks. well, it seems to be right. how much is that in dollars, please?

person beta:
just a moment, sir. i'll calculate that for you. it comes to 305 dollars and 52 cents at today's exchange rate.

person alpha:
i see. ok.

person beta:
how would you like to make the payment?

person alpha:
in cash, please. here you are.

person beta:
thank you, sir... here is your change. could you check it, please? thank you for choosing our hotel. i hope you enjoyed your stay.

person alpha:
by the way, please forward my mail to this address.

person beta:
certainly, sir. we hope you have a good trip.

person alpha:
hi, sam. i want to buy a pet. do you have any ideas?

person beta:
you really should go to rachel's pet store.

person alpha:
why? anything special there?

person beta:
it's more than special. you can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more.

person alpha:
oh, really? are there any snakes?

person beta:
snakes? there are even rodents and monkeys! it's a world of exotic pets.

person alpha:
that's terrific. i can't wait to check it out.

person beta:
hang on. are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet?

person alpha:
why not? it's so cool.

person beta:
but it will pose a risk to your health.

person alpha:
pardon?

person beta:
i mean, most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria. they are likely to cause immune system problems.

person alpha:
well, i didn't realize that.

person beta:
i don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets, especially for families with young children.

person alpha:
oh, i should have thought of my brother's baby girl. maybe i'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet.

person beta:
yes, good luck, maria.

person alpha:
i'm a new student. my name's robert.

person beta:
nice to meet you. my name's sophie.

person alpha:
are you french?

person beta:
yes, i'm. are you french, too?

person alpha:
no, i'm not.

person beta:
what nationality are you?

person alpha:
i'm italian. are you a teacher?

person beta:
no, i'm not.

person alpha:
what's your job?

person beta:
i'm a keyboard operator. what's your job?

person alpha:
i'm an engineer.

person beta:
i can't believe obama is our president.

person alpha:
i am proud to know that he is our president.

person beta:
you voted for him, right?

person alpha:
did you vote for him, because i know that i did.

person beta:
i did, too.

person alpha:
i have nothing but faith in obama.

person beta:
really?

person alpha:
i'm sure he will help better america.

person beta:
we do need some change in this country.

person alpha:
our country is already changing as it is.

person beta:
you're absolutely right.

person alpha:
i trust that he will take good care of our country.

person beta:
do you have a reservation, sir?

person alpha:
no, i'm afraid we don't.

person beta:
i'm sorry the restaurant is full now. you have to wait for about half an hour. would you like to have a drink at the lounge until there's a table available.

person alpha:
no, thanks, i'll come back later. may i reserve a table for two?

person beta:
yes, of course. may i have your name, sir?

person alpha:
bruce by the way, can we have a table by the window?

person beta:
we'll try to arrange it, but i can't guarantee sir.

person alpha:
that's fine.

person beta:
your table's ready, sir? please step this way.

person alpha:
do you have coffee shops in china, too?

person beta:
yes, of course. there are many tea houses and bars in china, too. people can drink, eat and relax at these places.

person alpha:
you like to go to these places, don't you?

person beta:
yes, sometimes the music there is so beautiful. it is very romantic. i can stay there for hours.

person alpha:
do you often go there alone?

person beta:
no, i often go there with my friends.

person alpha:
hi there! i am looking for a new car. i have this old ford pinto that i would like to trade in.

person beta:
i see. you are in luck this month because all of our models are on sale! it is a perfect time to buy a new car since it's the end of the year.

person alpha:
perfect! i like this one.

person beta:
that is the ford focus. a very light but powerful vehicle. it comes with dual side airbags, power steering and power windows, tinted windows and your choice of either automatic or manual transmission.

person alpha:
sounds like a good car! how many miles to the gallon?

person beta:
it is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the highway.

person alpha:
that is really convenient. especially now that fuel prices are so high! what's under the hood?

person beta:
a very powerful 2.5- liter turbocharged engine, trust me, this car is fast!

person alpha:
now for the most difficult question. what is the price tag for this lovely vehicle?

person beta:
very affordable mam. you can take it out of this lot today with 0% down payment and no interest for the first year! you can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back.

person alpha:
great! let's do it!

person beta:
i wonder if you could help me, i'm looking for a room.

person alpha:
well, i have got a vacancy.

person beta:
what sort of price are you asking?

person alpha:
eight dolls fifty a week excluding laundry.

person beta:
would it be convenient to see the room?

person alpha:
can you call back later? we're right in the middle of lunch.

person beta:
could you give me an expense report? i would like to attach the invoices for my phone bill this season.

person alpha:
here you are. do you need glue?

person beta:
that is very kind of you. i'm just running out of glue.

person alpha:
you're welcome.

person beta:
iba, jane speaking. how can i help you?

person alpha:
hello. i'd like to speak to someone regarding my card.

person beta:
sorry, i'm not quite sure if i understand. in what way, sir? has your card been stolen?

person alpha:
no, no. nothing at all like that. it's just that i applied for a credit card with you a while ago, my application was accepted, but i'm still waiting for my card.

person beta:
oh, i see, sir. well, it does take 5 working days to issue and post the card.

person alpha:
yes, my application was accepted last friday. now it's wednesday, that's more than 5 days.

person beta:
sorry, sir, but it's 5 working days. this does not include weekends, so your card should be with you later this week.

person alpha:
of course! how silly of me! yes, 5 working days would mean this friday, at the earliest. i see. i'm sorry to trouble you.

person beta:
it's no trouble at all, sir. is there anything else i can help you with today?

person alpha:
nothing, thanks. i again apologise for the misunderstanding, bye for now.

person beta:
what can i do for you, sir?

person alpha:
we'd like to order breakfast for tomorrow morning.

person beta:
yes, sir. what would you like?

person alpha:
orange juice, scrambled eggs, bacon, toast and coffee.

person beta:
ok, and when shall i bring it here?

person alpha:
about seven thirty.by the way, could you also bring me tomorrow's papers?

person beta:
of course, sir.

person alpha:
what shall we do when we find a shortage in the shipment?

person beta:
you should do one of the two things- either to lodge a claim with the shipowner or with the insurance company.

person alpha:
shall we leave it to the brokers?

person beta:
yes. they usually do it.

person alpha:
do they charge for that?

person beta:
of course. in europe, they charge a commission of 1% of the amount of the claim for their service.

person alpha:
is it the same in america?

person beta:
they do the work without charge to the importer.

person alpha:
it's part of their service, isn't it?

person beta:
exactly.

person alpha:
is it enough to claim with an on board bill of lading?

person beta:
no, you must also obtain a statement from the shipping agent certifying that the goods were actually loaded on their vessel for shipment.

person alpha:
i see. by the way, how do we prove the ownership of our goods?

person beta:
you must provide full original set of ocean bills of lading original insurance policy or certificate and the original commercia invoice.

person alpha:
i see. thank you.

person beta:
you are welcome.

person alpha:
i'll be on business for a couple of days, could you take care of your sister?

person alpha:
all right. shall i enter all my belongings?

person beta:
no, only the articles listed on the declaration.

person alpha:
i'm hungry, let's go grab a bite to eat.

person beta:
yeah me too. oh! can we stop at the shop really fast? i lost my makeup bag at the airport and i want to pick up a few things.

person alpha:
will you take long?

person beta:
no! five minutes i promise!

person alpha:
come on! we have been here for almost an hour! i thought you said you were only going to get a few things! how long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish!

person beta:
are you crazy? you have no idea what you are talking about! just for my eyes i have to get eye-liner, an eyelash curler, eye shadow, an eyebrow pencil and mascara. then i need to get foundation, liquid foundation.

person alpha:
whoa whoa whoa! are you nuts? how much is all this going to cost? i'm looking at the price at each one of these little things and it's outrageous! this is basically a crayon!

person beta:
what about you? you spend as much or more money on your razors, after shave, cologne and gel! not to mention how much you spend on clothes and...

person alpha:
fine! get the stupid thirty dollar crayon!

person beta:
can i borrow five bucks?

person alpha:
no!

person beta:
come on! i'll pay you back on tuesday.

person alpha:
last time i lent you money, you never paid me back.

person beta:
i promise if you lend me five dollars today, i will repay you in full next week.

person alpha:
ok, but i'm taking your skateboard as collateral.

person beta:
fine! i can't believe you don't trust me.

person alpha:
it's nothing personal, just business.

person beta:
may i help you, sir?

person alpha:
yes, please. i'm looking for a cotton polo shirt.

person beta:
any particular colour?

person alpha:
not really.

person beta:
how about this one?

person alpha:
i like the design, but don't particularly care for the colour. do you have that in other colours, too?

person beta:
well, they come in white, pale yellow, aqua, red and green. will a white one do?

person alpha:
yes. i prefer white- and may i see a pale yellow one, too?

person beta:
why, of course. let's see... white... pale yellow. here you are, sir.

person alpha:
i'm so surprised to meet you in this remote village. long time no see.

person beta:
yeah. how are you these days?

person alpha:
you look terrific and in good shape.

person beta:
thank you.

person alpha:
how do you keep fit?

person beta:
i do yoga twice a weeks

person alpha:
yoga? it sounds interesting.

person beta:
it was hard at the beginning, but now feel it's really relaxing. it makes me flexible.

person alpha:
anything else?

person beta:

person beta:
out in the suburbs. it's a long trip to work every day.

person alpha:
how are you going to find an apartment?

person beta:
i'm going to buy a newspaper and check the classified ads.

person alpha:
apartments in the city are expensive.

person beta:
i know, but i'm going to enroll in a night school to take a course in business management.

person alpha:
no, no, you helped me with my computer last week. i want to repay the favor.

person beta:
no, it's definitely my turn to treat you... you paid last time!

person alpha:
oh, that was just a quick bite to eat---that doesn't count!

person beta:
ok, ok, how about we just go dutch? it's settled. listen, i'm still pretty new around here, would it be alright if you found the restaurant?

person alpha:
ok... sure.

person beta:
i am waiting for a fax but just now i found there's something wrong with the fax machine.

person alpha:
what's wrong with the fax machine? is it urgent?

person beta:
yes, very urgent. and there is no other fax machine around. and the office of our boss is closed, so i can not use his machine either. and his secretary is out. do you have any suggestion?

person alpha:
either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail, you print it out.

person beta:
hey, jim. it's time to wake up and get out of bed.

person alpha:
do i have to get up now?

person beta:
you'd better get up, or you'll be late.

person alpha:
what're you talking about? my alarm even hasn't gone off yet.

person beta:
yes, it did. it went off thirty minutes ago. you slept right through it. you're like a dead person while you sleep.

person alpha:
i must have slept right through it.

person beta:
rise and shine! sleepyhead!

person alpha:
just let me sleep five more minutes.

person beta:
the early bird gets the worm.

person alpha:
i know, i know. but i don't want any worms.

person beta:
ha! ha! if you don't make an effort now, later on it'll be a lot tougher for you.

person alpha:
what shall we do tonight?

person beta:
how about the cinema?

person alpha:
that's a good idea. we haven't seen a film for ages. what would you like to see?

person beta:
oh i don't know. titanic?

person alpha:
titanic? that old film? but i've seen it before!

person beta:
i've been told you might have a vacant room.

person alpha:
yes. i have a spare room.

person beta:
how much are you asking?

person alpha:
10.00 dollars a night.

person beta:
could i see the room, please?

person alpha:
sure.come on in.

person beta:
sit down, please. what's wrong with you?

person alpha:
i feel cold, and i'm shivering. i have a terrible headache and a sore throat.

person beta:
how long have you been like that?

person alpha:
about a day.

person beta:
let me have a look at your throat first. please open your mouth and say" ah".

person alpha:
ah...

person beta:
and show me your tongue... thank you. that'll do. you have slight tonsillitis, and your throat is inflamed. how is your appetite?

person alpha:
not so good.

person beta:
now, let me take your temperature. please put this thermometer under your armpit and let me feel your pulse?

person alpha:
your pulse is weak.

person beta:
do i have a temperature, doctor?

person alpha:
yes, you have a high fever. i'd like to give you a blood test.

person beta:
yikes! what was that noise?

person alpha:
i had to blow my nose.

person beta:
did you have to blow right next to the phone?

person alpha:
did you hear that?

person beta:
of course i heard that. i thought a plane had crashed into your house.

person alpha:
it wasn't that loud.

person beta:
i will blow my nose sometime for you, and you'll see.

person alpha:
okay. i'll take your word for it.

person beta:
i thought you had an elephant in your house.

person alpha:
you're funny.

person beta:
what did you say? i think i've gone deaf.

person alpha:
i'm going into the bathroom to blow my nose. i'll be right back.

person beta:
can i have the check please?

person alpha:
right away, sir.

person beta:
is this amount correct?

person alpha:
yes, sir, it is.

person beta:
thank you, the service was good

person alpha:
please come again.

person beta:
nowadays fewer and fewer people go to the movie theaters to see films. so i am afraid that the film studios are really getting hard time to survive.

person alpha:
what you said is true. but the film producers there are more flexible ways to get more audience. for example, to make more movie ccds, so people will spend money buying them.

person beta:
but it is true that cinemas are losing the attraction they used to have in the past.

person alpha:
yes. take myself for example. i seldom go to cinemas, but it doesn't mean i no longer see films; instead, i see films at home-watching ccds.

person beta:
okay, well i'm sure you have a number of questions to ask me regarding the position.

person alpha:
yes, well miss childs did give mean overview of the position over the phone, but there were some details i'd like to clarify.

person beta:
well feel free to ask me anything, and i'll try to fill in the details.

person alpha:
could i first ask about the remuneration package?

person beta:
yes, of course. that's quite an important point, isn't it? as a junior sub editor we offer a starting salary of 150,000 hk dollars per annum. this doesn't include a generous housing allowance also.

person alpha:
i understand. and are there other bonuses included?

person beta:
well, apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers. but we could go through all the details of that at a later date.

person alpha:
well, mr. parsons, i am flexible when it comes to salary. the opportunity to work in hong kong for you is the most important thing for me.

person beta:
excellent. well, what other questions do you have rebecca?

person alpha:
we need to take the accounts system offline to carry out the upgrade. but don't worry, it won't cause too much inconvenience. we're going to do it over the weekend.

person beta:
how long will the system be down for?

person alpha:
we'll be taking everything offline in about two hours'time. it'll be down for a minimum of twelve hours. if everything goes according to plan, it should be up again by 6 pm on saturday.

person beta:
that's fine. we've allowed forty-eight hours to be on the safe side.

person alpha:
welcome to iba. can i help you?

person beta:
yes, please. i'm here for an international settlement. our company has to effect payment, and it needs to be done today. here's the advice slip for the payment.

person alpha:
thanks. i'm sorry to say that you need to get this stamped. there is no stamp on this slip and it is essential before i can process it for you.

person beta:
i see. so, i need to stamp it. and sign it too?

person alpha:
yes, that's right. down here, at the bottom right hand corner to show that you agree to pay the printed amount.

person beta:
i'll go back to the office and get it sorted and pop back later. thanks, bye for now.

person alpha:
that's the warehouse where the large items of office equipment are stored.

person beta:

person alpha:

person alpha:
i'll take the student bus pass.

person beta:

person alpha:
tuesday morning.

person beta:
have you bought a bus pass yet?

person alpha:
i'm not getting one.

person beta:
why is that?

person alpha:
it's cheaper if i don't buy one.

person beta:
buying a bus pass will save you money.

person alpha:
how do you figure that?

person beta:
there's no limit to how often you can use your bus pass.

person alpha:

person beta:

you're welcome.

person beta:
good morning. i need to speak with the property manager, please.

person alpha:
good morning. you are speaking to the property manager.

person beta:
while it was raining last night, water started leaking in from the ceiling.

person beta:
it was in the living room.

can you tell me which floor you are on?

person beta:
we are on the bottom floor.

person alpha:
i would like to look at the leak. will you be home this morning?

person beta:
yes, someone will be here to let you in.

person alpha:
just in case you have to leave, we will just use the master key.

person beta:
how much is your last salary?

person alpha:
i have earned 10,000 a year including bonuses.

person beta:
how much do you want us to pay you?

person alpha:
i like to be paid more than that. hopefully, 150,000 a year. to be honest, i left the company to get more income.

person beta:
i hope you can help. i've got a bit of a problem with your atm.

person alpha:
of course, that's my job. oh, dear. what's happened?

person beta:
well, it's eaten my card! it won't give it back!

person alpha:
i see... calm down, don't worry. may i ask what were you doing when it took your card?

person beta:
yes. i was only entering my pin. i'm terrible at remembering it, i'm so forgetful, you see.

person alpha:
mmmm... and exactly how many times did you enter it, please?

person beta:
maybe three times. as i said, i always forget it.

person alpha:
ah! don't worry; it's just a security measure. if someone uses a card and cannot get the right pin after three attempts, the bank keeps the card in case it's stolen. just contact the bank and we'll get it back to you.

person beta:
oh, i see. so if i call my branch they can sort everything out for me?

person alpha:
yes, they'll be happy to help. believe me, it happens to many people.

person beta:
i'd better try harder to memorise my pin in future. thanks.

person alpha:
is this the counter to pick up parcels?

person beta:
yes, it is.

person alpha:
i want to pick up my parcels.

person beta:
please show me your parcel order.

person alpha:
ok. here you are.

person beta:
let me check your parcel number. song ping's parcel number should be cp 06230221 5 cn. here is your parcel.

person alpha:
thank you.

person beta:
not at all.

person alpha:
hi brittany. what are you doing with all of your clothes on your bed?

person beta:
i'm trying to decide what to wear to school the first day.

person alpha:
oh, a. mom didn't tell you?

person beta:
didn't tell me what? what?

person alpha:
this bs'school you're going to is going to make your life easy.

person beta:
what are you talking about brother? spill it.

person alpha:
uniforms, sis, no more worrying about appearances!

person beta:
you mean i have to wear the same thing every day? mom!

person alpha:
what would you like for your main dish?

person beta:
steak, please.

person alpha:
how would you like it?

person beta:
medium rare, please.

person alpha:
anything else, sir?

person beta:
may i have a glass of red wine, please?

person alpha:
of course.

person beta:
mr. smith, do you like the hotel we booked?

person alpha:
yes, we do. we like it very much.

person beta:
i've come to make sure that your stay in beijing is a pleasant one.

person alpha:
thank you so much.

person beta:
david, we have been doing business for three years, haven't we?

person alpha:
yes, i'm glad we've had very pleasant cooperation in the previous years. and your achievement for promoting our clothes was great in the three years.

person beta:
so, i wish to apply for the sole agency of your product in our local market. if you give us the agency, that will be more substantial for our cooperation.

person alpha:
to be frank, you are not the only one who applies for an agent for us in your country. i'd like to know some ideas of terms on which you would be willing to operate as our agent.

person beta:
as we are a well-established company, we are very familiar with the customers'needs. besides, we can make full use of our good connections with the wholesalers and retailers here and develop a good market for your products if appointed as your agent.

person alpha:
sounds reasonable. i will tell my boss about you agent application. another question, what do you think is the minimum annual sales you can guarantee?

person beta:
to be on the safe side, and for garment of all materials, sizes, and styles, i think the amount will be 50,000 pieces a year.

person alpha:
well. as our sole agency, you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own.

person beta:
no, certainly not.

person alpha:
excuse me.

person beta:
yes?

person alpha:
i bought this circulator here yesterday but it doesn't work.

person beta:
oh, let's see what's wrong.

person alpha:
where can i find the produce?

person beta:
aisle a is where you'll find all the produce.

person alpha:
what sales do they have today?

person beta:
i'm sure something is on sale. please check with the produce person.

person alpha:
hello, this is steven from blue sky co. may i speak to mr. james?

person beta:
speaking.

person alpha:
excuse my troubling you. you purchased our products last year and now i am following up to find out about their workings. are they still in good condition now?

person beta:
yeah, exactly! i bought them last year. en... at present, they are still in good state.

person alpha:
that's it! all of them have first-class quality and performance. besides, we adopt advanced technology. now we have developed new products. they are much better than what you have bought.

person beta:
your company is developing so fast. maybe later on i will plan to buy more.

person alpha:
that's great! thanks for your support. if any, please remember to call us. i am afraid i have to say goodbye now! bye, mr. james!

person beta:
bye!

person alpha:
ms.dawson, i need you to take a dictation for me.

person beta:

person alpha:
this should go out as an intra-office memorandum to all employees by this afternoon.are you ready?

person beta:
yes, sir.go ahead.

person alpha:
attention all staff... effective immediately, all office communications are restricted to email correspondence and official memos.the use of instant message programs by employees during working hours is strictly prohibited.

person beta:
sir, does this apply to intra-office communications only? or will it also restrict external communications?

person alpha:
it should apply to all communications, not only in this office between employees, but also any outside communications.

person beta:
but sir, many employees use instant messaging to communicate with their clients.

person alpha:
they will just have to change their communication methods. i don't want any- one using instant messaging in this office.it wastes too much time! now, please continue with the memo.where were we?

person beta:
this applies to internal and external communications.

person alpha:
yes.any employee who persists in using instant messaging will first receive a warning and be placed on probation.at second offense, the employee will face termination.any questions regarding this new policy may be directed to department heads.

person beta:
is that all?

person alpha:
yes.please get this memo typed up and distributed to all employees before 4 pm.

person beta:

person alpha:
let's see... my id card, my passport, and my suitcase. i'm pretty sure i've got everything.

person beta:
this is dunlin. is this mrs smith speaking?

person alpha:
yes, what can i do for you?

person beta:
i just want to call and say thank you for letting me interview yesterday.

person alpha:
you are welcome, mr. sun.

person beta:
and i also want to know what the status is of the position.

person alpha:
sorry, we haven't made the decision at all. but we should be making the decision by the end of this week. and we'll get in touch with you once we make it.

person beta:
do you have any questions we didn't cover in the interview?

person alpha:
no.

person beta:
thank you, i am looking forward to hearing from you. bye-bye.

person alpha:
thank you for the calling. bye-bye.

person beta:
i often sneeze after having a bad itch inside my nose. sometimes this is accompanied by an itching throat.

person alpha:
any other discomfort?

person beta:
yes. sometimes i can notice a constriction in the chest and shortness of breath after a fit of sneezing. and i often suffer from a running nose with a profuse watery discharge.

person alpha:
does it occur seasonally or all year round?

person beta:
it has been seasonal during these past three years.

person alpha:
are you sensitive to other things?

person beta:
yes, things like seafood and penicillin-type drugs.

person alpha:
ok. let me examine your nose. according to your case history and the examination, i believe that it's allergic rhinitis.

person beta:
what useful treatment can you offer?

person alpha:
i'll give you a series of specific skin tests. then we'll know exactly what substances you're allergic to. then i'll give you some causes of desensitization therapy.

person beta:
miss, would you like to try this free sample of our new suntan cream?

person alpha:
sure, why not?

person beta:
this is a new product of company this year. it's oil-free.

person alpha:
i see. it feels very light on the skin.

person beta:
it gives your skin a very natural healthy look.

person alpha:
i like the cool smell, too.

person beta:
so how can i make it?

person alpha:
first you make a list of what you wanna buy...

person beta:
but i've gotta have the budge before anything else.

person alpha:
well, that's a problem, isn't it?

person beta:
did you have a part-time job when you were still in school?

person alpha:
no, i was way too busy studying all the time. how about you?

person beta:
yeah, i worked about twenty hours a week in a pizza restaurant.

person alpha:
what was that like?

person beta:
it was always very busy there.

person alpha:
what did you do?

person beta:
i stood behind the register and took pizza orders.

person alpha:
did you get any perks on the job?

person beta:
yeah, i got to eat as much pizza as i could for free.

person alpha:
hi. may i help you?

person beta:
yes. what's the buying rate for euro?

person alpha:
1.15 u. s. dollars to the euro.

person beta:
okay. i'd like to change some euro into us dollars, please.

person alpha:
sure. how much would you like to change?

person beta:
six hundred euro.

person alpha:
very good. may i see your passport?

person beta:
here you are.

person alpha:
how would you like your bills?

person beta:
in fifties please.

person alpha:
why are you reading the classifieds? what do you need?

person beta:
i'm looking for a bookcase, but i don't want to buy a new one.

person alpha:
are you having any luck?

person beta:
not really. there aren't any used bookcases listed. but there are a few rummage sales on saturday. i think i'll go to them.

person alpha:
do you mind if i go with you?

person beta:
not at all. these private sales are great places to bargain. and sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk.

person alpha:
i learned to negotiate from my mother. i thought i was pretty good at bargaining, but i had a problem the other day at kimble's department store.

person beta:
what happened?

person alpha:
i wanted to buy a beautiful wool sweater for my girlfriend. it was priced at forty dollars, so i started by offering the salesclerk thirty.

person beta:
do you do a lot of your shopping online?

person alpha:
not really. i like looking on the internet at what's available, but i usually prefer to actually see and touch what i'm buying before i pay for it. sometimes, i'll look at something in a shop, but lat

person beta:
no. i'm a little worried about security. you never know who's trying to find out your codes and passwords. aren't you worry about that?

person alpha:
not really. i know that it happens, but if you buy from reputable companies with secure websites, you should be ok. even though i use online shopping facilities, i don't think it's the best way to sho

person beta:
i'm surprised to hear you say that. i thought you loved anything technological.

person alpha:
i do. i'm a big fan of using new technology, but i don't want to sit in front of a computer screen all day. i think people need to get out and interact with other people.

person beta:
so, how about coming to the department store with me? i want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet.

person alpha:
sure. i'd love to join you. can we stop by the computer store? i just want to see if they have something.

person beta:
sure. while you're in the computer store. i will visit the book store opposite. i like to browse through their books and see if they have anything interesting.

person alpha:
ok. i've finished online. let's go. i'll just get some money and my credit card.

person beta:
thanks for reminding me. i had forgotten to get mine.

person alpha:
please help yourself at your dishes. i hope you'll enjoy what you've got.

person beta:
it suits my taste. you are really a good cook.

person alpha:
would you like to try my special recipe?

person beta:
wow, let me try. it tastes nice. how did you make it?

person alpha:
it's as easy as pie. i always follow recipes.

person beta:
mr. dick. does the recommendation of the university play an important role?

person alpha:
yes. in fact, the recommendation letter written by the university is an indirect self-recommendation. in the long period of cooperation, the university has established good relationship with the companies or organizations, they trust each other well. if your university recommends you, you can be approved more easily.

person beta:
but i find that most of the recommendation letters written by universities are the same. so i doubt its authority.

person alpha:
more and more persons have the same discoveries since most universities do that in order to save energy. if your university also does like this, you can look for other methods, because such kinds of recommendations say nothing for you.

person beta:
could you tell me whether or not i send out my resume with it?

person alpha:
it depends. if it has something special or useful, i suggest you send it out.

person beta:
taylor, can you tell me how to apply for a job on the internet?

person alpha:
just fill out an application.

person beta:
do i have to send an e-mail?

person alpha:
you are expected to know the e-mail address of the unit.

person beta:
but i still don't know which unit is in need of staff.

person alpha:
send out an application through job-wanted on the website.

person beta:
can any unit see my information?

person alpha:
it's a two-way choice. and your application will be read.

person beta:
which websites offer this service?

person alpha:
sina, 21st century talent net, and a few others.

person beta:
thank you.

person alpha:
don't throw your weight around. i can't bear you any more.

person beta:
i dare you to say that again.

person alpha:
were you a leader when you were in college?

person beta:
yes. i was propaganda department minister of our university.

person alpha:
did you get any honors or awards at your university?

person beta:
no. it's a pity about it.

person alpha:
were you involved in any club activities at your university?

person beta:
yes. i was a member of the basketball society. i like playing basketball.

person alpha:
what extracurricular activities did you usually take part in at your college?

person beta:
i sometimes played basketball and sometimes played football.

person alpha:
you want to argue your ticket today?

person beta:
yes. that is why i'm here.

person alpha:
tell me your argument.

person beta:
i was pulled over for allegedly speeding.

person alpha:
are you sure you weren't speeding?

person beta:
to be honest, i really wasn't.

person alpha:
what speed were you going?

person beta:
i was under the speed limit. i was going 35, when the speed limit was 40.

person alpha:
i'm just going to let you go, since the arresting officer isn't here.

person beta:
what about my ticket? do i still need to pay?

person alpha:
don't worry about it.

person beta:
i'm so glad for your help.

person alpha:
annie, do you like shopping online?

person beta:
yes, i like it, because it's convenient.

person alpha:
last week, i tried to buy a new cellphone online, but i didn't know how to pay for it.

person beta:
first, you should open an account at the online bank. after that, you can buy anything you want online.

person alpha:
are there many things online?

person beta:
sure. you can find everything all over the world. let's check it out online!( they log in a shopping website.)

person alpha:
that's amazing. oh, an on line virtual supermarket?

person beta:
let's click to check it out.

person alpha:
oh, i got it. it simulates the real supermarket, which makes it feel so real. mom will love it. she loves shopping in supermarkets.

person beta:
ah, bob. just the person i wanted to see.

person alpha:
so what is it?

person beta:
you gotta help me out this time, buddy.

person alpha:
another tough thing, i guess.

person beta:
hey! what happened?! my song was only half way through and it skipped to the next song.

person alpha:
i don't know what happened!

person beta:
you cancelled the song, didn't you, jack?

person alpha:
no, i didn't. really!

person beta:
then, is the machine broken or...

person alpha:
good evening, do you have a reservation?

person beta:
yes. the reservation under mr. watson.

person alpha:
ah, yes, a table for four at 8

person beta:
em, no, thanks. i think we'll go straight to the table, by the way. may i check my overcoat here?

person alpha:
certainly, sir. we'll keep it in the cloakroom for you. here is your number. when you leave, show it to the waiter behind the counter, please.

person beta:
thank you. could you show us to our table now?

person alpha:
would you please follow me, please?

person beta:
thank you.

person alpha:
this is your table. it's number 10.

person beta:
hello, ma'am. can i help you?

person alpha:
i'm looking for a sweater.

person beta:
what size are you looking for?

person alpha:
well, i'm looking for size 10 but you don't have it.

person beta:
how about this one? i think it looks terrific on you.

person alpha:
yes, i like the color. can i try it on?

person beta:
sure. the fitting room is on your right.

person alpha:
it fits well. i like it a lot. what do you think?

person beta:
you look pretty in red.

person alpha:
oh, it's my favorite. how much is it?

person beta:
$ 29.99.

person alpha:
okay. i'll take it. thank you very much for your help.

person beta:
you're welcome.

person alpha:
do you have any cars available?

person beta:
we have only one mid-size car left.

person alpha:
great, what's the rate per day?

person beta:
it's 40$ plus tax per day on limited mileage.

person alpha:
i'm going to need it for three days.

person beta:
can i see your driver's license?

person alpha:
sure, here is my driver's license.

person beta:
please sign here.

person alpha:
are you ready to order?

person beta:
i think that we have a pretty good idea of what we would like to order.

person alpha:
let me tell you about the specials of the day, which are chicken in a wine sauce with capers, and grilled garlic shrimp.

person beta:
i was wondering if the chef could leave off the sauce.

person alpha:
the chef would be happy to accommodate your special requests.

person beta:
i am a vegetarian. do you have any vegetarian selections?

person alpha:
you could choose the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza or the goat cheese and candied walnut salad.

person beta:
i think that we will split the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza.

person alpha:
that is a good selection, and i can bring your salads now or serve them with your entree.

person beta:
you can bring us our salads when you bring us our entree.

person alpha:
i can't open this email attachment our paris office has sent me.

person beta:
are you sure you're using the right program?

person alpha:
well, yes it's definitely the same program but i might have the wrong version. their system is newer than ours.

person beta:
that's why you can't open it. you'll have to upgrade before you can read the file.

person alpha:
what kind of character do you think you have?

person beta:
generally speaking, l am an open-minded person.

person alpha:
what is your strongest trait?

person beta:
cheerfulness and friendliness.

person alpha:
how would your friends or colleagues describe you?

person beta:
they say mr. sun is a friendly, sensitive, caring and determined person.

person alpha:
what personality do you admire?

person beta:
i admire a person who is honest, flexible and easy-going.

person alpha:
how do you get along with others?

person beta:
i get on well with others.

person alpha:
hi, i need to make an appointment to see the doctor.

person beta:
what seems to be the problem?

person alpha:
i have a rash that i need a doctor to look at.

person beta:
do you have a fever with that rash?

person alpha:
no, it just itches a lot.

person beta:
i have openings on tuesday or wednesday. which would be best for you?

person alpha:
i need an appointment on tuesday.

person beta:
fine, i am putting you down for 9

person alpha:
i would like to see dr. jones.

person beta:
i can schedule you with him with no problem. we look forward to seeing you.

person alpha:
wow! what's the hold up?

person beta:
it's probably just people trying to get an early start out of the city for the weekend. nobody sticks around in the summer.

person alpha:
really? then, i guess i won't have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab?

person beta:
actually, you might because there's a big convention in town this weekend.

person alpha:
i'm not too worried about it. i always seem to find something.

person beta:
hello, how can i help you today?

person alpha:
i'd like to withdraw some money from my account.

person beta:
please fill out this slip stating how much you wish to withdraw.

person alpha:
well, actually, it's quite a substantial amount. here's my bank book. will that cause a problem?

person beta:
on your account there is no limit to over the counter withdrawals, it won't cause a problem. here's your money, 10,000 rib. please count it before you leave.

person alpha:
yes, that seems to be all in order. thanks very much.

person beta:
quality is very important to us. we work to very low tolerance levels. we need to have guaranteed supplies of consistently high quality raw materials. over the years we've built up very good relationships with our suppliers.

person alpha:
do you have many different suppliers?

person beta:
yes. there are about fifty names on our approved supplier list, but for raw materials we tend to deal with three local companies.

person alpha:
mary, can you tell me how you keep in shape?

person beta:
you'll never be in shape until you eat less and take more exercise.

person alpha:
now, tell me what you often eat.

person beta:
i often eat fish and eggs.

person alpha:
do you eat a lot of vegetables?

person beta:
oh yes, and fruits. i love fruits very much.

person alpha:
what do you like to drink?

person beta:
well, i never drink alcohol, coffee or tea.

person alpha:
whatever would you like to drink?

person beta:
i drink a lot of milk. i drink milk almost every day.

person alpha:
how often do you exercise?

person beta:
well, i walk every day.

person alpha:
it's a good diet and a regular exercise.

person beta:
yes, quite right.

person alpha:
i am sorry, but i cannot stay for the rest of class today.

person beta:
why do you need to leave early?

person alpha:
i don't feel so good.

person beta:
what doesn't feel right?

person alpha:
i feel as if i am going to be sick to my stomach.

person beta:
perhaps you should get checked out at the student health center before you go home.

person alpha:
i have some medicine at home that i could take.

person beta:
are you going to be ok to drive home, or would you like someone to go with you?

person alpha:
thank you, but my friend is in the library, and he can give me a ride home.

person beta:
we hope that you are feeling better soon. e-mail me if you have any questions.

person alpha:
your boyfriend is so considerate to you. when do you plan to marry?

person beta:
it's still up in the air. there is something wrong between us.

person alpha:
we're considering of ordering 200 computers, but i'm wondering about the price you'll possibly offer.

person beta:
our price will be not less than$ 5000.

person alpha:
your price is higher than i expected. could you give us a little discount?

person beta:
this is already our best price.

person alpha:
but the price is always negotiable and you should consider our quantity of order.

person beta:
well, what would you suggest?

person alpha:
could you make it$ 4500?

person beta:
i'm afraid that there is no room to negotiate the price. this is the best price we can quote.

person alpha:
can we meet each other half way?

person beta:
what do you mean?

person alpha:
let's close the deal at$ 4800, ok?

person beta:
you drive a hard bargain! ok, that's a deal.

person alpha:
i'm now on the songshan airport getting ready for departure. i realized that i might have left my watch.

person beta:
yes, ma'am. may i have your name and room number?

person alpha:
my name is terry. i stayed last night in your hotel in room 132.

person beta:
what kind of watch is it?

person alpha:
it's a brand-new seiko wrist watch.

person beta:
yes, we have it.

person alpha:
oh, i'm glad to hear that. would you kindly send it to the hilton hotel?

person beta:
what are your thoughts on the apartment?

person alpha:
i think that it's absolutely gorgeous.

person beta:
there aren't any problems with the apartment?

person alpha:
i think that the apartment looks very nice, but i do see some problems.

person beta:
what problems?

person alpha:
i did notice a few stains in the carpet.

person beta:
we will have the carpet cleaned before you move in.

person alpha:
you will?

person beta:
yes, but other than that, are there any more problems?

person alpha:
that was the only thing that i saw that was wrong with the apartment.

person beta:
i'm happy that you find this apartment so appealing.

person alpha:
it is. i love it.

person beta:
that china-gown of tang-dynasty style is so beautiful. would you show it to me, please?

person alpha:
absolutely. here it is.

person beta:
could i try it on?

person alpha:
please do, the fitting-room is over there.

person beta:
it feels a little tight around the waist. do you have a bigger one?

person alpha:
i'm sorry. we don't have this color in your size. we have some green ones in your size. would you please have a look at this green one?

person beta:
ok. how much does it cost?

person alpha:
it's 486 yuan.

person beta:
mrs. wang, would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable?

person alpha:
as i said before, your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid. we hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap.

person beta:
just to comply, we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent. i hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling.

person alpha:
so do we. certainly it's a step forward on your side. but the gap is still too wide.

person beta:
the ball is in your court, mrs.wang. what price would you suggest?

person alpha:
to make your offer workable, i think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken.

person beta:
that won't do. you see, our profit margin is very narrow. it simply can't stand such a big cut.

person alpha:
i hate to disappoint you, mr. brown, but if that's the case, we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere. do think it over, please. we sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion.

person beta:
well, i'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction. would you mind waiting a day or two, until i get a reply from the home office?

person alpha:
not at all. shall we meet again, say, on friday morning?

person beta:
good. friday morning at 9.

person alpha:
good morning.

person beta:
good morning.this is mary.can i speak to anne please?

person alpha:
i'm sorry she isn't in at the momment.she will come back at half past ninecan i take a message for her?

person beta:
thank you.but i will call her later

person alpha:
ok.goodbye.

person beta:
goodbye.

person alpha:
hi, jane. how are you doing this morning?

person beta:
i'm all right, thanks. just a little tired.

person alpha:
late night?

person beta:
yeah, i got home around two.

person alpha:
we've been waiting here for nearly ten minutes now, and there still isn't a bus in sight.

person beta:
i'm afraid we'll be late for the party.

person alpha:
have you got the time, tom?

person beta:
yes, my watch says a quarter to seven. but there is something wrong with my watch!

person alpha:
but you bought it only last month.

person beta:
yes, but ever since i bought it, it gains about five minutes a day, so i've got to have it repaired.

person alpha:
how long will it take us to get there?

person beta:
i think about ten minutes by bus.

person alpha:
it's not far away, then. let's walk, it's beginning to rain.

person beta:
wait! i think i see a bus coming now. let's hope it's the no. 22 bus.

person alpha:
hi, mr. smith. i'm doctor hawkins. why are you here today?

person beta:
i found it would be a good idea to get a check-up.

person alpha:
yes, well, you haven't had one for 5 years. you should have one every year.

person beta:
i know. i figure as long as there is nothing wrong, why go see the doctor?

person alpha:
well, the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early. so try to come at least once a year for your own good.

person beta:
ok.

person alpha:
let me see here. your eyes and ears look fine. take a deep breath, please. do you smoke, mr. smith?

person beta:
yes.

person alpha:
smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease, you know. you really should quit.

person beta:
i've tried hundreds of times, but i just can't seem to kick the habit.

person alpha:
well, we have classes and some medications that might help. i'll give you more information before you leave.

person beta:
ok, thanks doctor.

person alpha:
good afternoon. mr. tylor's office?

person beta:
i'm afraid you've got the wrong extension.

person alpha:
i'm sorry, but could you please transfer this call to mr. tylor's office?

person beta:
sure, please hold on.

person alpha:
thank you.

person beta:
now mr. tylor's on the line. go ahead, please.

person alpha:
you are so kind, you helped me a lot.

person beta:
you are welcome. bye!

person alpha:
good afternoon, lexington software. angelina dawson, how can i help?

person beta:
hello, this is quinn from iba.

person alpha:
ah, hello quinn. oh dear, you are calling to tell me there is a problem, aren't you?

person beta:
i'm afraid so, yes.

person alpha:
hmm... well, it was my first attempt! is it a very big mistake, or can we just alter it?

person beta:
unfortunately it's rather a big mistake.

person alpha:
what do you recommend we do?

person beta:
i would recommend we scrap this one and you bring in another set as soon as possible.

person alpha:
i trust your judgement. thank you, quinn. i'll be back tomorrow with a new set. bye for now.

person beta:
oh!!! i have a horrible toothache.

person alpha:
you should go to the dentist.

person beta:
i hate dentists.

person alpha:
well, suffer then. if you have a toothache, you have to go to the dentist.

person beta:
it always hurts. i hate going.

person alpha:
stop being such a baby. if it really hurts that much, just let them knock you out.

person beta:
o. k., o. k., i'll go.

person alpha:
good. you'll feel better after you do.

person beta:
hi, i would like to purchase a one way ticket to brussels, please.

person alpha:
certainly sir, this is our train schedule. we have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm.

person beta:
how long does it take to get there?

person alpha:
about twelve hours. we currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train. if you'd like, you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive.

person beta:
yeah, i think that is the best option. do you serve food on the train? twelve hours is such a long time!

person alpha:
yes, of course. there is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times. we do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers.

person beta:
great! i'll take it.

person alpha:
here you are sir. your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot. remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train!

person beta:
i understand. thank you very much!

person alpha:
have a great trip.

person beta:
i would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend.

person alpha:
a trip to the beach would be fun. how is the weather going to be?

person beta:
the forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend.

person alpha:
so do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach?

person beta:
it sounds like it will be.

person alpha:
i really hope it doesn't get cold.

person beta:
that would ruin things, i want to go so badly.

person alpha:
the weather in california is unpredictable, so you never know.

person beta:
that is true. the weather is constantly changing.

person alpha:
it would be nice if the weather would never change.

person beta:
that would be great, then we could plan things sooner.

person alpha:
true. predictable weather would make life easier.

person beta:
some companies use to ban dating among employees, but now they have realized it is something in avertable. people spend so much time at work. it is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other.

person alpha:
if we think positively, office love can be beneficial to company.

person beta:
beneficial? i don't think so. if two employees get married, they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon, or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies. if they break up, the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable. by any means, the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating.

person alpha:
but if two employees are in love, they will be happy. happy people are more productive. if they develop an intimate relation with each other, they are willing to share knowledge and experience. it can help to improve work efficiency.

person beta:
i doubt that.

person alpha:
do you eat a lot of healthy food?

person beta:
compared with healthy food, unhealthy food just tastes so much better. and anyway, i believe if you live a low stress life and are active, you can get away with eating whatever you like. it's all in the mind.

person alpha:
you have the point. i think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume. some good things you should try are cranberry juice, wild rice and yoghurt.

person beta:
what's special about these things?

person alpha:
cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic. wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-i think it's also tastier than normal rice. yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein, vitamins and is also acidic. people have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day, your guts will be much more settled.

person beta:
thanks. i'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now.

person alpha:
i've been so tired recently. i've been trying, but i don't think i'm up to this job.

person beta:
you need to take a break, maybe a vacation.

person alpha:
oh, yes, indeed. i've run out of steam. to be honest, i want to be in a different environment.

person beta:
is that so?

person alpha:
yes, i don't want to be stuck in a rut. i want to move on.

person beta:
have you decided?

person alpha:
yes. i want to get a better job.

person beta:
could you tell me why you want to quit?

person alpha:
i quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues.

person beta:
oh, that's terrible. do you want to get a higher salary in our company?

person alpha:
i'm afraid not. i've promised my girlfriend. we'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay.

person beta:
ok, i'd like to say that i've really enjoyed working with you. however, i think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay.

person alpha:
thank you so much for your advice.

person beta:
and every best wish for your new job.

person alpha:
thank you.

person beta:
the train is leaving. hurry up! which car are we in?

person alpha:
let me see. oh, no. 11.

person beta:
here we are, car 11. let's get in.

person alpha:
seats no. 20 and 21. it's nice that we've got a window seat.

person beta:
let's put our suitcases on the rack.

person alpha:
oh, the baggage rack is full. put them under the seat for the time being.

person beta:
all right.

person alpha:
so, how should we get to the theatre?

person beta:
let's take the bus.

person alpha:
i hate the bus system in london! the bus drivers are rude, the buses are never on time, and there are few people around who can help you.

person beta:
it's not that bad. you probably just had a bad experience once.

person alpha:
it wasn't just once. every single time i take the bus, something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus.

person beta:
we could take the subway, but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice.

person alpha:
train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare, too.

person beta:
if we don't hurry up, we'll miss the show. should we take the bus?

person alpha:
we're already late, so i think we had better take a taxi.

person beta:
i don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours. let's just take the bus.

person alpha:
fine. have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives.

person beta:
it looks like it should be here in just a few minutes. don't worry. nothing bad will happen. i'll even buy your ticket for you.

person alpha:
thanks, that was nice of you.

person beta:
see, now something good has happened to you on a bus trip!

person alpha:
let's go over this plan again.

person beta:
from vancouver, we bike along the border all the way to winnipeg.

person alpha:
and that is mostly flat, right?

person beta:
relatively, once we're out of alberta, anyway. then it's hills again in aitoba.

person alpha:
and from winnipeg we go around the lakes through toronto, right?

person beta:
that's right. and up in to quebec. and that's where we stop.

person alpha:
it doesn't sound like that much when we go over the plan but that's a long, long ride.

person beta:
are you ready for the cross country of a lifetime?

person alpha:
good morning, sir. what can i do for you?

person beta:
i'm bill. i'm in room 908. can you change the room for me? it's too noisy. my wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made. she said it was too much for her.

person alpha:
i'm awfully sorry, sir. i do apologize. room 908 is at the end of the corridor. it's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when all is quiet.

person beta:
anyhow, i'd like to change our room.

person alpha:
no problem, sir. we'll manage it, but we don't have any spare room today. could you wait till tomorrow? the american people-to-people education delegation will be leaving tomorrow morning. there'll be some rooms for you to choose from.

person beta:
all right. i hope we'll be able to enjoy our stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep.

person alpha:
be sure. i'll make a note of that. everything will be taken care of. and if there is anything more you need, please let us know.

person beta:
it's time for bed.

person alpha:
i'm not ready to go to sleep. i'm not tired.

person beta:
it's quite late, and you have an early day tomorrow.

person alpha:
i'm not going to be able to fall asleep.

person beta:
why don't you try counting sheep?

person alpha:
i've tried that before. it really doesn't work.

person beta:
that's beside the point, you still need to go to bed.

person alpha:
why can't i just stay up until i fall asleep?

person beta:
if i let you do that, then you're just going to be up all night.

person alpha:
i promise i'll go to sleep soon.

person beta:
no, you're going to sleep now, so good night.

person alpha:
see you in the morning.

person beta:
i see myself as being honest, diligent, persevering and creative. and i have a strong sense of responsibility.

person alpha:
how about your psychological resilience?

person beta:
i think i can work well under pressure, if necessary.

person alpha:
how would you deal with those who are not easy to get along with?

person beta:
i will just be sincere and friendly to others, and i believe they will treat me the same way.

person alpha:
you seem to be a kind-hearted lady.

person beta:
thank you. i simply believe the goodness of human nature.

person alpha:
please tell me your weaknesses if you can.

person beta:
i should admit that sometimes i care too much about the details. i am always in pursuit of perfection.

person alpha:
karen? i need to go over a few things with you.

person beta:
certainly. mr. graham. when would you like to meet?

person alpha:
i was thinking about this afternoon, after the sales meeting.

person beta:
fine. at 3:30?

person alpha:
i believe we've met before. my name's david.

person beta:
yes, at your company, i think. i'm frank.

person alpha:
oh, i remember now.very nice to meet you again.

person beta:
nice meeting you, too.

person alpha:
i made my little brother cry.

person beta:
shame on you!

person alpha:
i need some mascara. do you have good thickening mascara?

person beta:
of course. here is our thickening mascara. we also have mascara designed to lengthen the eyelashes.

person alpha:
alright. and i want to consider your eye shadow too. do you have a color chart can look at?

person beta:
we have a very wide selection of colors. and our eye shadow is specially designed to moisturize the skin. so it is very gentle on your eyelids. would you like to sample some?

person alpha:
oh, sure i will need to clean off my own eye shadow first.

person beta:
i can help you with that.

person alpha:
thank you.

person beta:
is this the baggage claim area for flight kb256?

person alpha:
yes, we are on the same plane.

person beta:
but i am a transfer passenger. i have a connecting flight to miami.

person alpha:
so you have to bring your baggage to the transfer check-in area.

person beta:
yes.it's quite troublesome.

person alpha:
why not go and find a porter?

person beta:
billy, you don't look too well. maybe you should take the day off school.

person alpha:
but mom! today we're playing football! i love football!

person beta:
you've got a fever and playing football isn't a good idea for a boy with a fever. what's that on your arm?

person alpha:
i don't know. it was there when i woke up this morning.

person beta:
it's rash. i'd better take you to see the doctor. how did you get that bruise on your leg?

person alpha:
i bashed it against the chair in my room.

person beta:
does it hurt?

person alpha:
a little, but not much.

person beta:
here. put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down. i'll take you to the doctor's after breakfast.

person alpha:
if i'm better this afternoon, can i go to school?

person beta:
if you are better, but i doubt you will be.

person alpha:
this is your schedule.

person beta:
you're going out of your way for us, i believe.

person alpha:
you are our honored guests.

person beta:
are there any vacancies still available?

person alpha:
yes. we need a plumber here.

person beta:
i am looking for a job that is more advanced than that, such as sales manager or regional manager.

person alpha:
i am sorry. they are not available now.

person beta:
my name is mary, and i will be your waitress tonight.

person alpha:
thank you, mary. we have been looking forward to trying out this restaurant.

person beta:
before your main course, would you like to order an appetizer?

person alpha:
sure, that sounds great. where are your appetizers listed?

person beta:
there is a special appetizer menu right here in the center of the table.

person alpha:
the chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good. is that pretty good?

person beta:
you know, that is one of my favorites!

person alpha:
ok, i'll take one order of that.

person beta:
you could choose another appetizer for half price to share.

person alpha:
perfect! please add on an order of onion rings.

person beta:
i am waiting for a fax but just now i found there's something wrong with the fax machine.

person alpha:
what's wrong with the fax machine? is it urgent?

person beta:
yes, very urgent. and there is no other fax machine around. and the office of our boss is closed, so i can not use his machine either. and his secretary is out. do you have any suggestion?

person alpha:
either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail, you print it out.

person beta:
i would like to speak to you, if you don't mind.

person alpha:
what would you like to speak to me about?

person beta:
i would like to talk to you about this year's election.

person alpha:
is that right?

person beta:
i am a volunteer for this year's campaign.

person alpha:
that's wonderful. i am impressed at someone so young taking a stand.

person beta:
i know history is about to be made, and i would like to be a part of it.

person alpha:
that's fantastic.

person beta:
are you planning on voting?

person alpha:
i'm going to vote.

person beta:
go to your polling place early on election day.

person alpha:
i will. good luck with your volunteering.

person beta:
we hope that there will be no repetition of this kind of trouble in the future.

person alpha:
yes. i promise it will not happen again.

person beta:
we look forward to your settlement at an early date.

person alpha:
we will inform you as soon as possible.

person beta:
hello, steven. how do you get along with your job?

person alpha:
actually, i learn many things from it. i find that i am a quick learner in new things.

person beta:
practice makes perfect. by the way, what do you learn from your job?

person alpha:
at first i didn't know anything about the machine. now i know how to operate it. besides, the work gives me a sense of fulfillment and achievement.

person beta:
yeah, you are a good learner. i must commend you for your good performance.

person alpha:
thank you. that's a long way to go for my job.

person beta:
i appreciate your effort very much. the coffee break is over; it's about time we set to work.

person alpha:
ok, let's go.

person beta:
where on earth are we?

person alpha:
judging by all the traffic, i'd say we're near the outskirts of the city.

person beta:
what did i do wrong? did i take a wrong turn?

person alpha:
i'm not sure, but i think you turned right when you should have turned left on the flyover bridge.

person beta:
well, now we should turn back a few kilometres.

person alpha:
it seems that the traffic sign is much more important than the map.

person beta:
hello. front desk.

person alpha:
yes. this is bob robinson. i'm calling from room number 627.

person beta:
hi, bob. what can i do for you?

person alpha:
is it possible to change to another room?

person beta:
could you please tell me why?

person alpha:
my room is facing the swimming pool. it's noisy for me. i have a problem sleeping. and i feel uncomfortable when i take an elevator.

person beta:
so you need a quiet side room on the lower floor.

person alpha:
you're right.

person beta:
okay. let me check for a room on the first floor.

person alpha:
thank you.

person beta:
i've only two rooms on the first floor. how about room 108?

person alpha:
that's fine. can i move now?

person beta:
sure. i'll send the bellman to help you.

person alpha:
oh, thank you kindly.

person beta:
you're welcome.

person alpha:
how long will it take for our order to be delivered?

person beta:
let's see. you are importing fifty containers of textiles from china. they should be able to place your order before the end of next week. it will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of ningpo. the freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in los angeles approximately a month from today. domestic shipping will be your responsibility, you can make arrangements with the pier in los angeles.

person alpha:
fine, we will handle domestic shipping, but what about customs? will we have to pay tariff on our imports? i hope we don't run into any problems with the border control.

person beta:
no, the chinese company has that all worked out. with the paperwork you receive with the shipment, you should be good to go.

person alpha:
now you're my boss, mr. henry.

person beta:
do you have any other particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration?

person alpha:
no, nothing in particular.

person beta:
you may ask questions about us, if you have any.

person alpha:
all right. when can i start?

person beta:
what are you doing here today?

person alpha:
i would like to fight my ticket.

person beta:
is the arresting officer in the courtroom today?

person alpha:
yes, the officer is here today.

person beta:
what's your case?

person alpha:
i was pulled over for running a red light, but i never did.

person beta:
do you believe that the officer lied?

person alpha:
there was a camera on the signal. so, he was obviously lying.

person beta:
your license plate was caught on camera?

person alpha:
a picture of my license plate was never taken.

person beta:
since there is no picture of your license plate on record, i'm going to let you go.

person alpha:
thank you. i'm glad that you believe me.

person beta:
hey joe, what are you doing in this department store?

person alpha:
hi, rita, i'm just looking for a pair of shoes. i won't be here for long.

person beta:
why not? when i go shoe shopping, i have so many options for sneakers that i spend awhile looking at all of the choices.

person alpha:
that's my problem. i don't have a lot of options.

person beta:
what do you mean? this is a big store, isn't it?

person alpha:
yes, but i have unusually big feet. that wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide, and only a few brands sell shoes that i can fit into.

person beta:
so how do you usually go about buying shoes, then?

person alpha:
well, first of all, i can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection.

person beta:
well, you're in the right store. if they don't have it, no one will.

person alpha:
after that i choose something from one of the few brands that i know will fit me. i prefer white, so i ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size. since i'm usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications, it makes it a very easy choice.

person beta:
what shall we do after the volleyball match?

person alpha:
how about going to the olympic souvenir store to have a look? i remember there is one in the gym.

person beta:
that's a good idea. i was thinking of buying some gifts for my family.

person alpha:
me, too. what did you have in mind?

person beta:
i haven't decided yet, but i think the olympic mascots are a must.

person alpha:
i agree. they're very lovely, especially" huan huan".

person beta:
is that the red one? that is my favorite, too. do you know how much they are?

person alpha:
the five dolls are sold together as a set, and they're priced according to the size. the bigger they are the more expensive.

person beta:
oh, i see. if i buy more than a set, can i get any discount?

person alpha:
i don't think so. all the souvenirs of the olympic games are very hot right now.

person beta:
any other ideas?

person alpha:
there are lots of things, such as postcards, key chains, posters and various arts and crafts.

person beta:
it all sounds great. we can go there after the match. i can't wait to see what they have.

person alpha:
mom! i hate eating vegetables!

person beta:
you don't have to eat them. i don't mind.

person alpha:
thanks mom! can i have dessert now? i love chocolate cake!

person beta:
no dessert for you unless you eat all your vegetables.

person alpha:
but i don't like them! it's not fair!

person beta:
you can have some fruit for dessert. if you eat an apple and a banana, i might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake.

person alpha:
ok... actually, i don't mind eating peas and carrots, buy i hate broccoli and cauliflower.

person beta:
i'll remember that for next time. you'll get extra peas and carrots, buy no broccoli or cauliflower. ok?

person alpha:
thanks mom!

person beta:
it was very kind of you to give me a tour of the place. it gave me a good idea of your product range.

person alpha:
it's a pleasure to show our factory to our customers. what's your general impression, may i ask?

person beta:
very impressive, indeed, especially the speed of your nw model.

person alpha:
that's our latest development. a product with high performance. we put it on the market just two months ago.

person beta:
the machine gives you an edge over your competitors, i guess.

person alpha:
certainly. no one can match us as far as speed is concerned.

person beta:
could you give me some brochures for that machine? and the price if possible.

person alpha:
right. here is our sales catalog and literature.

person beta:
thank you. i think we may be able to work together in the future.

person alpha:
is the factory fully-automated?

person beta:
not completely. our production process is partially-automated. we use robots on the production line for routine assembly jobs but some of the work is still done manually.

person alpha:
what about supply of parts to the production line?

person beta:
well, the parts are automatically selected from the store room using a bar-code system. and there is an automatic feeder which takes them to the conveyor belt at the start of the production line.

person alpha:
what about the smaller components?

person beta:
they're transported to the workstations on automated vehicles- robot trucks- which run on guide rails around the factory.

person alpha:
i'm glad you're on your ten-year reunion planning committee.

person beta:
yeah, you get the tv to yourself while i spend my nights surfing the net for missing classmates.

person alpha:
that's not why. this way i can see how you guys do this sort of thing.

person beta:
i guess. don't you have reunions in taiwan?

person alpha:
definitely. every year. but just for our forty-person class.

person beta:
ours are for everyone that graduated in the same year.

person alpha:
what does your job involve?

person beta:
i'm the project manager so i have to make sure our projects run smoothly. i work with three project engineers. they take care of after-sales service and look after the maintenance side of the business.

person alpha:
how many languages can you speak?

person beta:
besides chinese, i can speak english and french.

person alpha:
you mean you can read and write both of them?

person beta:
no, i can only carry on a simple conversation in french.

person alpha:
can you read and write english well?

person beta:
i can speak the language better than read and write.

person alpha:
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of english-speaking countries?

person beta:
i think so. i used to be an interpreter.

person alpha:
do you think your english is good enough to do desk work?

person beta:
the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work. i believe what i know is sufficient to work in an american firm.

person alpha:
what can i get for you? here is the menu.

person beta:
let me have a look. well, how many kinds of steaks do you have?

person alpha:
we have sirloin steaks, pepper steak, and filet steak.

person beta:
is there something go with the filet steak?

person alpha:
yes, we have various sauces. what about the gravy?

person beta:
are you ready to go shopping?

person alpha:
just a minute. i need to make a list of thinks that we need.

person beta:
good idea. have you written down potatoes, carrots, and onions?

person alpha:
i don't have onions on my list. i'll add them. we should get some tea. is green tea ok or should we get the same tea that we usually get?

person beta:
let's get both. we need some coffee too. is that on your list?

person alpha:
yes, it is. here's my list. is there anything that i've forgotten?

person beta:
i think you've got everything. i want to got some chocolate and some cheese.

person alpha:
what kind of cheese do you want.

person beta:
i'm not sure. i'll decide at the cheese counter, when i can see what they have. have we got enough money?

person alpha:
we don't have enough cash, so i'll take my credit card and we can pay with that. where are the car keys?

person beta:
i've got them there. shall i drive?

person alpha:
hello, can you tell me how to use the telephone?

person beta:
if you want to order meals, call 8801.if you need other help, call 8803 and someone will be there.

person alpha:
thank you so much. by the way, is there a mail service?

person beta:
yes, you can take your letters to the counter over there.

person alpha:
hi, i am afraid that the fax machine in my room won't be working till tomorrow. a technician has just come and checked it. he will bring me a new one tomorrow. it seems there is a big problem with mine and it will take some days for repairing. can i use the one in your office?

person beta:
of course you can. i am sure this one works very well. i just sent dozens of pages. how many pages are you sending? are you familiar with my fax machine?

person alpha:
yes, i think you have the same model as i have. does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol?

person beta:
yes, it will print immediately.

person alpha:
how many years have you done business with china?

person beta:
let me see, about five years, we established our business relationship with hua mei of china import& export corporation in 2003.

person alpha:
do you have any difficulties in doing business in china? you know the chinese economic legislation is still incomplete?

person beta:
i don't think i have any problem with our chinese partners. they have always followed the contract strictly. we can do business directly with the corporation. as i mentioned before, the chinese government is trying very hard to perfect its law. its commercial legislation provides legal protection for foreign companies.

person alpha:
well, it's known that the sino-american relation is in a dilemma. does it influence your business in china?

person beta:
actually not at present. but we are afraid it will. you know policies influence business to some extent. i hope our government will not be influenced by some extremists. china is really a large market. we don't want to lose it.

person alpha:
thank you.

person beta:
you're welcome.

person alpha:
give me a pack of first-class stamps, please.

person beta:
here you are. that will be five dollars. anything else?

person alpha:
yes. i want some post cards and some airmail stamps. i want to send some letters to south america.

person beta:
just a moment, i'll look up the rate for air-mail letters to south america.

person alpha:
can you tell me how much it will cost to send a package to colombia? also, i what to know how long it will take.

person beta:
do you have the package with you? i would have to weigh it to see how much it would cost.

person alpha:
do you insure package?

person beta:
yes. all you have to do declare the value of the package and decide how much you want to insure it for.

person alpha:
is there a way that i can be sure that the people in south america receive my package?

person beta:
the post office rarely loses package. you can, however, request a rectum receipt.

person alpha:
one last question-what are your hours?

person beta:
we open at eight-thirty in the morning and close at five-thirty in the afternoon.

person alpha:
thank you, you helped me a lot.

person beta:
hello, thank you for taking the time to interview me.

person alpha:
hi there, i'm bill gotcha, the owner of gotcha enterprises. did you find your way here ok?

person beta:
your assistant gave wonderful directions.

person alpha:
why are you switching jobs at this point in your career?

person beta:
our company is moving overseas and i wish to stay in the united states.

person alpha:
what are you best at?

person beta:
i am good at organizing systems that have been having problems.

person alpha:
what is your biggest challenge in terms of skills?

person beta:
i don't like to sit around and so like to always find things to do to keep myself busy.

person alpha:
that is good to hear!

person beta:
good morning. src international. how may i help you?

person alpha:
good morning. i'd like to speak to peter. chen please.

person beta:
certainly. who should i say is calling?

person alpha:
this is tim. hunter from hunter industries.

person beta:
and what is it regarding please?

person alpha:
we have an appointment for this afternoon. mr. chen will know why i'm calling.

person beta:
of course, please hold the line mr. hunter.

person alpha:
right, let me run through your options. you can go ahead and cash your undue large-amount deposit certificate if you really want to, but i'd recommend a personal durable commodities loan.

person beta:
ok, what does that entail?

person alpha:
it's not too much trouble to do it this way and remember, your certificate is due in 2 months. if you can hold on to it, it'll be much better for your finances.

person beta:
yes, it does seem a little silly to cash it now. i'll probably need about 25,000 rib. will that be a problem?

person alpha:
not at all, mr zu. as the certificate is due in 2 months, you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate.

person beta:
i'm glad you thought of this. i'd have just gone ahead and cashed it! and i suppose i can use the money from the certificate to pay back this personal durable commodities loan and i won't lose any interest, right?

person alpha:
exactly right. if you'd like to go ahead, i can process that for you now, mr zu.

person beta:
absolutely, jenny. thanks very much, i think you've saved me quite a lot of money today.

person alpha:
my aunt told me one of her secrets--cellophane tape.

person beta:
i just got it at the special health store. it's for my flabby arms.

person alpha:
let me know how it works.

person beta:
i have to say, i have had enough of this roller coaster.

person alpha:
i know what you mean. i'm like a yo-yo.

person beta:
last week i was down to 60 kilos. this week i had one donut more. now i'm up to 62 kilos.

person alpha:
may i have a menu, please?

person beta:
of course.

person alpha:
could you tell me how this thing is cooked?

person beta:
lobster? it is steamed and served with our special sauce.

person alpha:
is it good?

person beta:
sure. it is a most popular dish.

person alpha:
i think i will try some lobster, and give me some green salad together.

person beta:
can't you come in and have tea now, peter?

person alpha:
not yet, i must water the garden first.

person beta:
do you have to water it now?

person alpha:
i'm afraid i must. look at it! it's terribly dry.

person beta:
what a nuisance!

person alpha:
last summer it was very dry, too. don't you remember? i had to water it every day.

person beta:
well, i'll have tea by myself. that was quick! have you finished already?

person alpha:
yes, look out of the window.

person beta:
it's raining. that means you needn't water the garden.

person alpha:
that was a pleasant surprise. it means i can have tea, instead.

person beta:
i'm broke, and i have to catch another bus.

person alpha:
why don't you have any money for another bus?

person beta:
i got hungry and bought some chips.

person alpha:
that was smart.

person beta:
anyway, do you have any change i can use for the bus?

person alpha:
i don't have any.

person beta:
i don't know how i'm going to get home.

person alpha:
get a transfer from the bus driver.

person beta:
how much is a transfer?

person alpha:
it doesn't cost anything.

person beta:
that's great! thanks for your help.

person alpha:
you know what? don't mention it.

person beta:
hello, anna. come in and sit down.

person alpha:
hello, doctor.

person beta:
what's the matter?

person alpha:
i've got a backache.

person beta:
do you often suffer from backache?

person alpha:
no, i don't. i've never had a bad one before.

person beta:
when did it start?

person alpha:
about four days ago.

person beta:
well, go home and rest in bed for two days, then you'll feel better.

person alpha:
can you give me some medicine? it's very painful.

person beta:
yes, i'll give you some pills. take one a time and three times a day, and come back in three days. if you don't feel...

person alpha:
welcome on board. may i see your boarding pass?

person beta:
here you are.

person alpha:

person beta:

person alpha:

person beta:
everyone's attention, please. we are going to take off. please fasten your belts.

person alpha:

yes, there are so many near our hotei.three blocks away from here, there is temple. it's famous for its building and paintings.lt's worth visiting.

person beta:
thank you. i think today we will go there.

person alpha:
you're here to make a deposit, is that correct?

person beta:
right. i'd like to deposit 2,000 rib into my current account.

person alpha:
no problem. could i have the cash and your bank book, please? oh dear... there seems to be some problems here...

person beta:
what? what's wrong?

person alpha:
i'm sorry but 5 of these notes seem to be counterfeit. look at this watermark, do you see it?

person beta:
it does look a little strange, i didn't notice that before.

person alpha:
hello, sir. is there anything i can help you find?

person beta:
um... uh... i'm just looking, thanks.

person alpha:
need a gift for your girlfriend or wife...

person beta:
no, no, no. i'm just browsing. thanks anyway.

person alpha:
well, if you need anything, just ask.

person beta:
um... well, where's the men's shoe department?

person alpha:
it's on the third floor. turn left when you get off the escalator.

person beta:
thanks.

person alpha:
an idea about killing time on a train?

person beta:
i advise you to read playboy.you can get a lot from it.

person alpha:
but there's quite a lot of rumors about it.

person beta:
that's why it's interesting.

person alpha:
have you brought the receipt with you?

person beta:
no, i don't. i left it home.

person alpha:
sorry, but we can't do anything without the receipt. come back with it.

person beta:

person beta:
yes, i am really excited.

person alpha:
that's great. congratulations.

person beta:
i appreciate that.

person alpha:
you have no idea how happy i am for you.

person beta:
for real?

person alpha:
i believe you were the best choice for that promotion. i really do.

person beta:
i like chinese food.

person alpha:
i like chinese food, too. i like dumplings best.

person beta:
at school, we sometimes have chinese food for lunch.

person alpha:
that's good. we eat chinese food only at the chinese restaurant.

person beta:
my mother can make some chinese food.

person alpha:
really? that's wonderful!

person beta:
ok. come back into the classroom, class.

person alpha:
does the class start again, mam?

person beta:
yes, but to the heath, this break has last long enough.

person alpha:
oh, breaktime flies.

person beta:

person alpha:
mam, another minute, could i?

person beta:
hurry up, little boy.

person alpha:
what's the matter, sir? you look pale.

person beta:
i feel dizzy and weak. and i'm having this pain in my ear. i think i am sick.

person alpha:
are you often traveling by plane?

person beta:
no, this is the second time.

person alpha:
that's right. it's normal if you don't often take the plane. just relax a little bit.

person beta:
why this happens to me when i am on the plane? i feel bad.

person alpha:
don't worry, sir. it's just because of the lower pressure.

person beta:
what should i do about it?

person alpha:
you may feel much better if you chew some gum or peanuts.

person beta:
ok, thanks. does it work really? i'll give a try.

person alpha:
are you feeling better now? do you need some pills?

person beta:
much better. thank you. i just feel tired but i can't fall asleep.

person alpha:
so, you'd better wear this eyeshade and you will sleep well.

person beta:
i am not used to wearing that. thanks.

person alpha:
if you try to adapt yourself to your destination's local time, you'll feel more comfortable. so please try to sleep, and have meals according to los angeles's time.

person beta:
thank you so much.

person alpha:
could i see the manager please? i have a complaint to make.

person beta:
yes, i'm the manager here. what can i do for you, madam?

person alpha:
did you have the room checked before we move in?

person beta:

person alpha:
the first thing we do is check the feel of the paper;d oes it feel too thick or too thin? then we check the watermark. in my opinion it is counterfeit. i'll just run it through the scanner to double check.

person beta:
what happens now?

person alpha:
well, it's our policy to confiscate all counterfeit notes. so, unfortunately you'll lose this 50 rib. we'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated.

person alpha:
i'm afraid i can't.

person beta:
why?

person alpha:
well, my car won't start. i don't know what's the matter with it.

person beta:
could it be the battery?

person alpha:
no, i don't think it could be. i checked the battery two days ago.it must be other problems.

person beta:
well, i suppose it could be the gas.

person alpha:
no, there is plenty of gas. i filled it up yesterday.

person beta:
perhaps it's the starter then?

person alpha:
yes, that's possible.

person beta:

person alpha:
yes, sometimes it happens, ma'am. that's why it is always good to carry your confirmation number. i'm sorry about the inconvenience.

person beta:
it's okay. it's probably my husband's fault.is there a pool in this hotel?

person alpha:
excuse me, i need to get to cambridge today.

person beta:
would you like to go by train or by bus?

person alpha:
i am not sure, which one is better?

person beta:
the bus is cheaper but also slower. it will take about two-and-a-half hours.

person alpha:
and how long does the train take?

person beta:
if you take the fast train, it will take about 50 minutes.

person alpha:
where do i catch the train?

person beta:
the trains for cambridge leave from king's cross station. they run approximately every half hour. most trains to cambridge go from platform 9.

person alpha:
how do i get to king's cross?

person beta:
the best way is to take an underground tube train directly to king's cross. the underground station is just round the corner from here.

person alpha:
can you show me on the map?

person beta:
it is very easy. just turn right when you leave and then turn right again at the first crossroads. the entrance to the underground station is about 50 meters further on.

person alpha:
thank you very much.

person beta:
you're welcome.

person alpha:
have you seen the sales report for last quarter? who do you think is our digest threat?

person beta:
from the numbers, it seems like forest inc. is our digest competitor... le'ban and markford are also major contenders in our market.

person alpha:
le'ban is the new kid on the block, it's amazing they've had such tremendous success so soon... with them on the scene, the competition is outthrough.

person beta:
here's information about our competitor's recent market activities...

person alpha:
thanks, this will be a big help in putting together next quarter's marketing strategies. with competition this intense, we'll have to step up production even more. we need a price we can compete with.

person beta:
we're in a very competitive environment. it's sink or saimin this market.

person alpha:
better start swimming! we've got to find a way to outsmart the other guys. i want a preliminarily strategic marketing plan on my desk by next tuesday... the competition never sleeps and neither should we.

person beta:
hello, this is hilton hotel. how may i help you?

person alpha:
hi. i would like to make a reservation on this friday.

person beta:

person beta:
ok. no problem.

person alpha:
we need to call an emergency meeting as soon as possible about this.

person beta:

person alpha:

person beta:
i don't think he's back today.

person alpha:
oh, that's right. go ahead anyways. i'll fill him in. we can't lose this order under any circumstances!

person beta:
i know, it's a big one.

person alpha:
would you mind if i ask some personal questions?

person beta:
no. i don't. please.

person alpha:
are you in robust health?

person beta:
i have a little problem, i'm overweight for my height. i think i should go on a diet.

person alpha:
the consignments of chemical instruments have just reached us. we have to lodge a claim against you for inferior quality i am afraid.

person beta:
is there anything wrong?

person alpha:
we bought 1,000 sets of chemical instruments from you, but there are 40 not up to the standard.

person beta:
it's hard for us to believe it. our instruments have been the best quality for years. have you any reliable evidence?

person alpha:
here is the survey report from a well-known public surveyor in london. you may inspect the defective instruments personally

person beta:
well. according to the contract, we are responsible for repairing or replacing those defective instruments. we'll send our technicians to repair them.

person alpha:
forty faulty instruments means that 4% are not up to the standard. you should compensate us for 4% of the total account on the contract, as well as for the inspection fee.

person beta:
i am sorry about the quality problem, but i propose we compensate you for 3% of the total value apart from the inspection fee.

person alpha:
all right. in that case we are still willing to do business with you.

person beta:
hi bill, i saw your grandma yesterday.

person alpha:
oh where was that?

person beta:
i was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track.

person alpha:
grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy. she is always making us kids eat the proper foods.

person beta:
well, it pays off for her. how old is she anyway?

person alpha:
she will be 86 next month.

person beta:
that is truly amazing!

person alpha:
did you punch in?

person beta:
yes. by the way, you are having a great make-up today. i like the color of your lipstick. so adorable!

person alpha:
really? it took me really a while to find the color. i am happy you like it.

person beta:
well, girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things. actually, do we still have a meeting this afternoon?

person alpha:
sure, when those never ending meetings.

person beta:
i don't think you've met my sister, mary.

person alpha:
no, i haven't had the pleasure.

person beta:
come and meet her now.

person alpha:
all right.

person beta:
excuse me, would you tell me how to return to hilton hotel. i'm afraid i lost my way.

person alpha:
did you have hotel card or something?

person beta:
let me see. yes, i have the address and hotel telephone number here.

person alpha:
oh, you stay at the down town hilton. when you go down two blocks this way and turn left, you will find it on your right.

person beta:
i don't understand very well. could you give me a map?

person alpha:
the bathroom looks lovely. did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you?

person beta:
i did it myself. i went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement. then i went to diy shop and bought everything i needed. i'm sure i saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too. i learnt a lot by doing it myself.

person alpha:
so, let's see. you have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls. you've also added a small cupboard for toiletries. the bath, shower, and washbasin are the same as before, aren't they?

person beta:
yes, they are. i gave them a good clean. they are in good condition and don't need to be replaced.

person alpha:
how long did it take you to do the tiling.

person beta:
as i hadn't done it before, i had to keep referring to income 3ation i got from the internet. doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening. then i spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles. putting the cupboard up took about an hour, so it took me two days altogether.

person alpha:
i think you've done a very good job. as least as good as a professional would do. perhaps i can convince you to redo my bathroom?

person beta:
you'll be lucky! however, i'll print out the income 3ation i got from the internet and you can do it yourself.

person alpha:
i'd like to see that pen, please.

person beta:
you mean this one?

person alpha:
no, the other one in the brown case.

person beta:
oh, this one... here.

person alpha:
may i try it?

person beta:
sure.

person alpha:
it's very smooth. i'll take it.

person beta:
cash or charge?

person alpha:
charge, please.

person beta:
i've come to hear about your offer for bristles.

person alpha:
we have the offer ready for you. let me see... here it is. 100 cases houston bristles, 57 mm, at 10 pounds sterling per kilogram, c. i. f european main ports, for shipment in june 2001. the offer is valid for five days.

person beta:
why, your price has soared. it's almost 25% higher than last year's. it would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price.

person alpha:
i'm a little surprised to hear you say that. you know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months. the price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere.

person beta:
i'm afraid i can't agree with you there. i must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we've received from other sources.

person alpha:
but you must take the quality into consideration. everyone in the trade knows that us's bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries.

person beta:
i agree that yours are of better quality. but there's competition from synthetic products, too. you can't very well ignore that. prices for synthetic bristles haven't changed much over the years.

person alpha:
there's practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses. that's why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones. to be frank with you, if it were not for the long- standing relationship between us, we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price.

person beta:
well, we'll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price. but i'll have to try, i suppose.

person alpha:
good morning.sir.my name is liu peng from tsinghai university. i am here for the interview relating to my visa application.

person beta:
glad to meet you.would you mind if i ask you some questions?

person alpha:
of course not.

person beta:
why do you want to go to the us?

person alpha:
i'd like to have further education.now i am studying for my doctorate.

person beta:
will you get any kind of scholarship?

person alpha:
yes. the school has provided me with full scholarship and that will be enough to support myself.

person beta:
could you say something about your educational background?

person alpha:
yes. i graduated from shanghai university and later obtained a master's degree from oxford.

person beta:
what was your graduation thesis on?

person alpha:
my graduation thesis is on international trade.

person beta:
hello, i'd like to open an account.

person alpha:
which account would you like to open?

person beta:
i'd like to open a savings account. what's the interest rate now?

person alpha:
it is 3.2%. you may earn a little interest on money.

person beta:
is there any minimum deposit for the first time?

person alpha:
yes, the opening minimum deposit is 1,000 yuan.

person beta:
what about the later deposits?

person alpha:
for the later deposits, you can deposit any you want. even one yuan is ok.

person beta:
ok, that's good.

person alpha:
your id, please.

person beta:
here you are, a thousand yuan and my id.

person alpha:
wait a moment, please... here is your bankbook. keep it well please.

person beta:
thanks. i will.

person alpha:
hello mr. jones, please have a seat. thank you for coming in today. i have read your resume. you completed university in england?

person beta:
yes, i went to cambridge. after graduation, i started right away into the advertising industry. later, i made a bit of a switch to focus on marketing research.

person alpha:
so, what experience do you have?

person beta:
i have ten years marketing experience. this includes both entry level and management positions. in my last position, i worked my way up to being director of the marking department.

person alpha:
i can see that from your resume.your last position was marketing director for a pharmaceutical company, is that right? later, why did you decide to leave your former post?

person beta:
i felt after five years in one place, i was ready for something new. i would like to have a job that is challenging, something that i can see and do new things every day. i loved many things about my former job, and i left with amiable feelings on both sides. i was just ready for something new.

person alpha:
i see. do you want to work full-time or part-time?

person beta:
i would rather work full-time.

person alpha:
i'll make note of that. now, what are your salary expectations?

person beta:
i am willing to negotiate, but i expect at least$ 40,000 a year.

person alpha:
my lease ends next month, so i have to find a new place.

person beta:
i feel sorry for you. it's a jungle out there.

person alpha:
do you know any places?

person beta:
well. i guess i can ask around to see if anyone's got a room or apartment available.

person alpha:
thank you. i think i should also have a look at the internet to see if anyone's got a sublet.

person beta:
how much do are you looking to spend?

person alpha:
i can only afford about 1,000 yuan a month.

person beta:
looks like you'll have to get a place in the suburbs.

person alpha:
it doesn't matter, but it needs to be close to the subway or on a convenient bus route.

person beta:
anything you need to have in the place?

person alpha:
i want a bedroom with full bath, and it'll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side.

person beta:
you can also check out university bulletin boards.

person alpha:
why? will those be students who are leaving?

person beta:
not really, but landlords put up notices to attract students and they often have low rent.

person alpha:
thank you. i'll be sure to take a look.

person beta:
good luck.

person alpha:
excuse me, but can i draw on my account for payment of things i buy in china?

person beta:
certainly, sir. how much do you draw?

person alpha:
rib 8,000, please. would you please tell me my balance?

person beta:
yes, sir. your balance is rib 34,000.

person alpha:
are you here about your ticket?

person beta:
yes, i am, your honor.

person alpha:
what is your argument?

person beta:
your honor, the police officer pulled me over for speeding.

person alpha:
you must've been speeding.

person beta:
no, your honor, i was not.

person alpha:
tell me how many miles per hour you were going.

person beta:
i was going 35 in a 40 mph zone.

person alpha:
that's fine, so i'll let you go with a warning.

person beta:
so, i don't have to pay the ticket?

person alpha:
you won't have to pay the fine.

person beta:
thank you very much, your honor.

person alpha:
yes! i finally lost that last five pounds i've been working on forever!

person beta:
how did you finally do it?

person alpha:
a friend suggested that i stop nibbling between meals.

person beta:
like snacking?

person alpha:
you know, a little piece of chocolate here, some chips on the side, candy now and then...

person beta:
i get what you mean.

person alpha:
instead, i sit down and have a good snack like a piece of fruit between meals.

person beta:
i'm impressed. good for you!

person alpha:
this is our submission of tender which includes the information about volume of the project, the cost and so on.

person beta:
ok! we'll see it.

person alpha:
what kind of guarantee are you going to provide for us?

person beta:
we can provide you with standby letter of credit established by bank of china.

person alpha:
should we pay earnest money?

person beta:
yes, you are supposed to pay it on time. if you don't furnish a tender bond on time, your tender will not be considered. besides, you also should provide derailed engineering of the good.

person alpha:
where do we submit the tender?

person beta:
to our office which is on the third floor.

person alpha:
oh, i see. by the way, is tender-opening done publicly?

person beta:

person alpha:
great. we have a very pleasant working condition and i think we have a fine staff to work with.

person beta:
mrs. phoebe, here are your ordered goods. please inspect the goods now.

person alpha:
all right. let me have a check. can you tell me how can you inspect your exported goods?

person beta:
our quality control department is in charge of the inspection, which is directly under general manager. it is essential to attach the importance to the quality of goods. it is the basement for the future cooperation.

person alpha:
that is good. and here i give you a piece of advice. you should have used stronger cardboard boxes for such a heavy item. besides, it's better to secure the cartons with metal straps. what's more, the order number wasn't anywhere on some of the boxes.

person beta:
i realize that now. i will do that after a while.

person alpha:
thank you. can i open the packages to check the color and style?

person beta:
of course, let me help you.

person alpha:
the color and style are consistent with the sample. great!

person beta:
you know, we are superior to other clothes companies.

person alpha:
yes, that's for sure. there is nothing wrong with the quality. i think you'd better pack them first in plastic bags, than in cartons.

person beta:
ok. we will manage it later.

person alpha:
daddy, are you going to the park with us this weekend?

person beta:
honey, i have a lot of work to do.

person alpha:
so you can't go with us, right?

person beta:
what about the olympic park?

person alpha:

person beta:
where is some fresh produce that's on sale?

person alpha:

person beta:
i've never had a mango.

person alpha:
it's a fruit. it has a big stone in it.

person beta:
can you eat the stone?

person alpha:
no. you would break all your teeth on it.

person beta:
how much are these mangoes?

person alpha:
the sale price today is$ 1 each.

person beta:
can you describe their taste?

person alpha:
they usually taste sweet, but they remind me of an orange.

person beta:
how can i tell if they're ripe?

person alpha:
don't cut into them until you can feel that they're soft on the outside.

person beta:
what country produces them?

person alpha:
they come from tropical countries.

person beta:
please sit down.

person alpha:
thank you.

person beta:
would you like a cigarette?

person alpha:
no, thanks. i've decided to give up smoking.

person beta:
really? why?

person alpha:
well, it's just that i think if you don't enjoy doing something any more, you should stop doing it.

person beta:
i see.you mean you don't enjoy smoking any more?

person alpha:
that's right. you should give it up, too.it's bad for your health.

person beta:
stop talking like my mother. that's what she keeps saying.

person alpha:
but it's true. it's a nasty habit. i can't think why i ever started.anyway, it's obviously got you in its grip!

person beta:
what do you mean? what are you talking about?

person alpha:
i mean you couldn't give it up!

person beta:
can you give me a hand with some things in the kitchen? i don't think i can finish everything in time.

person alpha:
my pleasure! this tea towel's a little ragged. do you have another one?

person alpha:

person beta:
well, to be honest, i just don't think we're going to have enough funds to give the kind of bonuses you have in mind.

person alpha:
well, why don't we sit down and work out the numbers? we can always scale down the bonuses if we have to.

person beta:
i take care of the letters. i may read, sort out and organize incoming mails.

if the weather is good, i'll go to climb mountains.

person beta:
are you going with your friends?

person alpha:
no, i'm going alone.

person beta:
oh, aren't you afraid?

person alpha:
of course not. for me, mountaineering is both relaxation and a hobby.

person beta:
i think mountaineering is an exciting sport, but a little dangerous.

person alpha:
yeah, you are right, but it's really interesting.

person beta:
hey! i just bought one of those new japanese cell phones! it's loaded with extras.

person alpha:
what does it do?

person beta:
it's got a built-in video camera so you can see the person you're talking to.it also takes stills and i can use the e-mail mode to send digital pictures straight to my friend's phone!

person alpha:
wow! what else does it do?

person beta:
i can plug it into a folding keyboard to type in message mode. l can even surf the net.

person alpha:
cool! anything else?

person beta:
yes.with the 600- second digital memory, l can record my voice and send it using voice message mode.

person alpha:
wow!

person beta:
you'll love this! i can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone.

person alpha:
you have the right to remain silent. anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. you have the right to have an attorney present during questioning. if you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you. do you understand?

person beta:
yes.

person beta:
american.

person alpha:
what's your relationship with the victim?

person beta:
i don't know him.

why did you attack the victim?

person beta:
because he beat me first when i tried to stop him from grabbing my bag and running away.

person alpha:
how many times did you stab the victim?

person beta:
i stabbed his belly three times.

person alpha:
did you know hat your actions might cause serous injuries or death?

person beta:
i knew, but i couldn't control myself.

person alpha:
was it your intention to kill the victim?

person beta:
no. i didn't kill him on purpose, madam. it's him who caused the incident. i need to see my attorney.

person alpha:
ok. give me his number and we'll contact him.

person alpha:
not too long.cut a little off behind and on both sides, too.

person beta:
ok.now lean back a little and keep still. i'm going to shave your face.

person alpha:
how long have we been flying?

person beta:
about 12 hours.

person alpha:
i always have trouble with jet lag.

person beta:
most people do when they travel long distances.

person alpha:
by the way, what's the time now?

person beta:
8: 00 beijing time.

this is a special adhesive for easing the pain. apply it to the painful area and change it in every 2 days.

person alpha:
how do i use the lotion?

person beta:
apply some of the ointment, and rub it into the skin.

person alpha:
well, thanks very much.

not at all.

person alpha:
cindy. we were going to try to surprise you for your birthday. but you're just too busy! can you tell me when you'll be free?

person beta:
oh, brian. that's really sweet of you guys. i would love to get together with all of you. how about friday?

person alpha:
great! what time?

person beta:
i'm free all afternoon. why don't we meet at 1 o'clock in the lobby?

person alpha:
i'll need to meet with you before you go on vacation, alex. i have a few things to clear up.

person beta:
i'll be glad to. but my schedule is super tight this week. i think the only time i have free is at lunch on wednesday.

person alpha:
that's fine. i can make that.

person beta:
all right, then. i'll see you at noon on wednesday.

person alpha:
i've got a temperature and my stomach hurts.

person beta:
how long have you been feeling this way?

person alpha:
it all started the day before yesterday.

person beta:
you seem to have picked up some kind of infection.

person alpha:
what should i do?

person beta:
take a few days off from work and don't wear yourself out.

person alpha:
what would you like to eat tonight?

person beta:
i'm not sure, what about you?

person alpha:
do you think kentucky fried chicken is good?

person beta:
sure sounds good to me.

person alpha:
did you clean your room today?

person beta:
no, not yet.

person alpha:
well, when were you planning on doing that?

person beta:
i'm going to clean it up later.

person alpha:
didn't i ask you to clean it up earlier?

person beta:
i'm going to clean it.

person alpha:
i want you to vacuum in your room, and don't forget to dust everything.

person beta:
i know. i'll do it.

person alpha:
make sure you clean it up before you do anything else.

person beta:
i'm not going anywhere until later, so i'll clean it then.

person alpha:
hello, can i help?

person beta:
i'm from lexington software and i'm here to collect an export l/ c.

person alpha:
i have it right here.

person beta:
great. can i take it with me now? or do you need me to fill in some forms or something?

person alpha:
no, you can take it away now. i just need you to sign here.

person beta:
here you are.

person alpha:
just one thing before you go, could you please prepare your documents in accordance with the l/ c within the validity period?

person beta:
no problem, i'll get on that right away. thanks, bye.

person alpha:
hello, mr. thomas. could you spare a minute?

person beta:
what do you need?

person alpha:
i need to talk to you about that new driver you've hired. i think i am going to have some problems working with him.

person beta:
he seems to be quite qualified. if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves.

person alpha:
i can't stand the stupid guy any longer. it's unbelievable!

person beta:
oh, my dear lady. take it easy. you should forgive a green hand like him.

person alpha:
he does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy.

person beta:
i suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems.

person alpha:
i have told him how to do it several times, but he's never listened to me.

person beta:
maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss.

person alpha:
oh, i always have difficulty in getting along with the staff.

person beta:
just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do, make sure you don't lose your temper.

person alpha:
i think that's a bad idea. i'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend. how would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want?

person beta:
i disagree. all you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions.

person alpha:
hey, you look great! how's everything?

person beta:
yeah, you know what? i've been going to the club regularly. the training really pays off. now i am in a good shape and i know more about how to keep fit.

person alpha:
really? tell me about it. i haven't gone to the club for a long time. i am too busy with work.

person beta:
it's important to do proper exercises.

person alpha:
you're right. too much or too little won't do any good.

person beta:
the trainer tells me, besides regular sports activities, i should also have a healthy and balanced diet.

person alpha:
sounds reasonable.

person beta:
we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic.

person alpha:
and fruits!

person beta:
surely it is. getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness.

person alpha:
i've heard that. does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit?

person beta:
yeah, he advises me to stay in a good mood. that can help one to keep sound physical health.

person alpha:
i think if you follow your trainer's advice, you'll be on the right track.

person beta:
you bet it!

person alpha:
staying out all night, you frightened me to death.

person beta:
i stayed with my friends.

person alpha:
you should at least give me a call.

person beta:
i'm sorry, mum.

person alpha:
did anyone call?

person beta:
just mr. white.

person alpha:
what did he want?

person beta:
he wouldn't say over the phone.

person alpha:
what kind of job do you intend to do?

person beta:
i want to do some management job since i have three-year's work history.

person alpha:
what are your plans if you were hired?

person beta:
i would apply my specialty and experience to my job and gradually move up to the management level in this company.

person alpha:
you stepped on my foot!

person beta:
sorry. i didn't mean to.

person alpha:
what do you think about the public service advertisement for quiting smoking?

person beta:
while i think it's great that they're trying to get people to quit smoking, but i don't really care for the advertisement.

person alpha:
why not?

person beta:
the fish hook that they use is quite disturbing!

person alpha:
it's a pun. they use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking.

person beta:
i know, but i think it's not really appropriate for young children.

person alpha:
i think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking.

person beta:
all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty.

person alpha:
perhaps you're right,, though. maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow.

person beta:
i have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults, but i don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them.

person alpha:
that's a good point. i think i was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that i didn't think about how children might understand the ad.

person beta:
you have to give them credit, though. it's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking.

person alpha:
good morning. could i speak with mr. willard please?

person beta:
this is he. who's calling, please?

person alpha:
this is chris emerson speaking.

person beta:
hello, chris. how can i help you?

person alpha:
can you tell me the differences between a letter and a memorandum, miss thong?

person beta:
certainly. a letter must be sent out of the company and must be mailed or posted. a memorandum is a communication within an organization.

person alpha:
should we use the layout we use for a letter when we write a memorandum?

person beta:
no, not necessary. usually we have a set form which is printed. we just fill in the printed forms and send it to the person or the offices concerned in the company.

person alpha:
of course, let me find one for you.

person beta:
hi, do you have any tickets for the show tonight?

person alpha:
sorry, it's all sold out.

person beta:
well, do you have any for tomorrow?

person alpha:
we have tickets for the matinee. it starts at 3p. m.

person beta:
ok. i'll take it.

person alpha:
where would you like to sit?

person beta:
do you have anything in the middle section? i want a good view, but sitting too close hurts my eyes.

person alpha:
certainly.

person beta:
lily, i am terribly sorry about this. but we have to put off or cancel tomorrow's meeting.

person alpha:
cancelled? that's just can't happen!

person beta:
sorry to say, but nothing can be done. the equipment broke down and can't be fixed till friday.

person alpha:
oh, i hope it be fixed on friday.

person beta:
overseas operator, may i help you?

person alpha:
yes. i would like to place a collect call.

person beta:
can you tell me the name and number of the person you want?

person alpha:
terry and his number is 4562325 8.

person beta:
please wait a moment. it will take a few seconds to get through.

person alpha:
would you help me figure out what to do about the office party?

person beta:
i would be happy to help. what would you like me to help with, food or entertainment?

person alpha:
i would like to help you with both.

person beta:
that will work out fine. to make sure everything goes together, do you think this party should be casual or dressy?

person alpha:
a dressy party would be fun!

person beta:
that will work out fine. do you think that chinese or continental food would be best?

person alpha:
we should probably have both.

person beta:
yes, that will work out fine. should we hire a band or bring in a dj?

person alpha:
maybe we could do both!

person beta:
everything sounds great then! i'll meet you back here on friday to discuss the details.

person alpha:
i can't find the price tag.

person beta:
it's right here.$ 100.

person alpha:
but i heard other stores were having great mark-downs on this item.

person beta:
ours are of really good quality.

person alpha:
i see, please wrap it.

person beta:
peter, how often do you exercise?

person alpha:
well, i swim and run every day.

person beta:
now, tell me, what do you eat?

person alpha:
well, i don't eat any meat, but i do eat fish and eggs.

person beta:
do you eat a lot of vegetables?

person alpha:
oh yes, and fruit, i love fruit.

person beta:
what do you drink?

person alpha:
well, i never drink alcohol, coffee or tea. they are very bad for you.

person beta:
what do you drink?

person alpha:
where can i call a taxi?

person beta:
there's a taxi rank over there, right outside the gate.

person alpha:
how did your company's fundraiser go?

person beta:
the fundraiser events went really well. we were able to partner with a few of our competitors, all in fun of course, to sponsor a marathon for the american cancer society. all of the people who participated it had a great time, and we were able to raise a lot of money to contribute to cancer research.

person alpha:
so how does it work? how were you able to make money with the marathon?

person beta:
each of the runners that participated the marathon race paid a ten dollar entrance fee. also, they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran. all in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars.

person alpha:
sounds like a great deal for the american cancer society.

person beta:
in all honesty, it's also a great deal for our company. the exposure that we gained from sponsoring an invent like this was great for our image in the community. we accomplished as much as last year's advertising campaign, plus we were able to do a little fundraising for a good cause.

person alpha:
how may i help you today?

person beta:
i need to open a second account.

person alpha:
what kind of account would you like to open?

person beta:
i need another savings account.

person alpha:
do you have another account with us?

person beta:
i sure do.

person alpha:
would you like to transfer money from that account into your new one?

person beta:
that's fine.

person alpha:
how much would you like to transfer?

person beta:
transfer$ 100.

person alpha:
give me a moment while i complete your transaction.

person beta:
that's fine. thank you.

person alpha:
how about your grades of study?

person beta:
i have been doing quite well. as reach 90% and bs reach 100%. and i've received scholarship two times.

yes. to develop my knowledge, i studied economics, business administration and accountingthrough self-study. nowadays, i have passed three courses on cpa.

person alpha:
have you ever been a student cadre?

person beta:
yes. i used to be the monitor of my class.

person alpha:
did it affect you much?

person beta:
it's a very important experience for me. first, it improved my organizing ability, and let me understand how to resolve a problem in the overall perspective instead of my own perspective. second, it let me know how to cooperate in harmony with people who i like or dislike.

person alpha:
in your spare time, do you have any part time jobs?

person beta:
yes, i used to work as an assistant lawyer for tienda law office.

person alpha:
what kind of a car do you have?

person beta:
an old one.

person alpha:
i know it's old, but what make is it?

person beta:
it's a chevrolet. why do you ask? you going into the car business?

person alpha:
nothing like that. my cousin is going to take a job overseas and he can't take his car with him, so he's going to sell it- cheap. it's practically new.

person beta:
well i have been thinking about getting a newer car. i can't afford a brand new one.

person alpha:
would you like to look at my cousin's car?

person beta:
is it a four-door or a two-door?

person alpha:
it's a coupe with a vinyl roof.

person beta:
does it have automatic transmission?.

person alpha:
yes, and it also has power steering, power brakes, and air conditioning.

person beta:
i guess i might take a look at it.

person alpha:
what is my prime responsibility in daily work?

person beta:
your main job is serving the clients and giving them what they want.

person alpha:
what other things do i need to know?

person beta:
you'd spend 30% of your time on the computer. you may be bored with a job like that.

person alpha:
no problem. i am used to it.

person beta:
good afternoon. may i help you?

person alpha:
yes, i'm here to see joanna stevens. i have an appointment at four.

person beta:

ms. stevens will be with you momentarily. can i offer you something to drink?

person alpha:
yes, a coffee would be nice, thank you.

person beta:
here you are. ms. stevens is ready for you now. i'll show you to her office, right this way.

person alpha:
how about your interview?

person beta:
they turned me down.

person alpha:
why? you are so excellent.

person beta:
i think the only reason is that i was too nervous during the interview and i couldn't express myself the way i wanted to.

person alpha:
what a shame! you should have showed yourself to them!

person beta:
it doesn't matter. i'll try other companies.

person alpha:
i suggest you hunt for a job on the internet.

person beta:
on the internet? i've never heard of it.

person alpha:
it's very convenient and it has become popular recently.

person beta:
is that safe?

person alpha:
of course, if you log on some standard websites.

person beta:
thank you for your advice. i'll have a try.

person alpha:
we are here.

person beta:
ok. how much is the fare?

person alpha:
the total is 45 yuan.

person beta:
45 yuan? it is too much, are you sure?

person alpha:
it is 45 yuan on the meter.

person beta:
is there something wrong with your meter?

person alpha:
no. i am sure about that.

person beta:
ok. could you give me a receipt?

person alpha:
yes. this is your receipt.

person beta:
excuse me. would you mind trading seats with me?

person alpha:
not at all.

person beta:
oh, thank you. that's very kind of you.

person alpha:
you're welcome. i prefer a window seat.

person beta:
oh, you do? good. looking out of the window sometimes scares me. so i prefer to be the man in the middle.

person alpha:
do you plan to further your study?

person beta:
yes, i have been always learning the economics on my own. my dream is to get a master's degree in economics.

person alpha:
if you make every effort to the company, you will have a great chance to attend the on-the-job postgraduate. the tuition fee will be financed by our company.

person beta:
really? it is amazing. i will apply for a position in your company.

person alpha:
ahem... uh, sir, i beg your pardon... uh, mister, are you waiting to buy a ticket for the movie?

person beta:
what's it look like, lady? this is the ticket line i'm standing in, isn't it?

person alpha:
well, yes, it is, but...

person beta:
so, what's your beef anyway, lady?

person alpha:
you just cut into line, in front of me and everyone else, that's what! go take your place back at the end of the line, like every- one else!

person beta:
oh sure, lady, and fat chance i'd get a ticket before they're sold out. i'm staying right here, understand? so be a nice lady and butt out!

person alpha:
just what gives you the right...?

person beta:
because i'm no sucker; only suckers go to the end of the line. it's as simple as that, lady.

person alpha:
well, you're no gentleman, either.

person beta:
okay, lady, just to show what a gentleman i really am, i'll let you go in front of me. now, just buy your ticket and shut your trap, will you, lady?

person alpha:
whew! i got the last one. this must be my lucky day!

person beta:
what was that you just said? last one...? hey, they've closed the ticket window!

person alpha:
yes, i'm afraid i bought the last ticket, and to think, if you hadn't been such a gentleman...

person beta:
lady! this is unfair! i've been cheated! i was in line before you.that should have been my ticket! come on, hand it over, lady!

person alpha:
gentleman! hah! fat chance! hah! eat your heart out, sucker! hah!

person beta:
may i help you?

person alpha:
yes. fill it up, please.

person beta:
premium or regular?

person alpha:
regular, please.

person beta:
anything else, sir? should i check the water and the oil?

person alpha:
yes, please.

person beta:
darling, the airplane is going to take off. i have to go.

person alpha:
take care! i will miss you so much.

person beta:
is there anything i can do for you?

person alpha:
i haver run out of gas.

person beta:
what kind of oil do you want?

person alpha:
premium, please. by the way, please don't fill it up. two gallons will be fine.

person beta:
no problem.

person alpha:
i'm starving. let's get something to eat.

person beta:
can we go somewhere nearby? i don't feel like walking too far.

person alpha:
sure. what kind of food do you like?

person beta:
i mean the food for something spicy.

person alpha:
how about some korean food? there's a place right there on the corner.

person beta:
that sounds great. i love korean food.

person alpha:
may i help you, madam?

person beta:
yes. i'm trying to find a pair of earrings to match my necklace. can you recommend some to me?

person alpha:
yes. your gold necklace has a diamond pendant, and your eardrops should be

person beta:
these look wonderful. do these come with a guarantee of quality?

person alpha:
of course. if there is anything wrong with them, you can come back and show me the guarantee of quality, and then you will surely get free service.

person beta:
i'll take them.

person alpha:
i've lost my purse.

person beta:
oh, dear. what was in it?

person alpha:
all my money.

person beta:
well. go to the police station and see if it's there.

person alpha:
royal hotel, can i help you?

person beta:
yes. i urgently need a room for tomorrow night, and do you have any vacancies?

person alpha:
yes, we have. what kind of room would you like?

person beta:
i'd like a suite with an ocean view, please.

person alpha:
no problem, sir.

person beta:
come in, please.

person alpha:
good morning! i am anna lu. i've come for an interview which was arranged.

person beta:
oh, i see. i am jack white, personnel manager. take a seat, please.

person alpha:
glad to meet you, mr. white.

person beta:
miss lu, have you got any experience in restaurant service?

person alpha:
yes. since i entered college, i have been working at a fast food restaurant as a part-time waitress.

person beta:
for how long?

person alpha:
3 years.

person beta:
our restaurant receives a lot of foreign customers. can you serve them in english?

person alpha:
that's why i applied for this job. now i am studying hotel english in my college, and i am quite familiar with the western courtesy and restaurant etiquette. i am sure my public relation skills will leave a strong impression on your customers.

person beta:
you must know our working hours are very long and overtime work is frequent.

person alpha:
i don't mind that.

person beta:
i think i will give you a 3 months'trial. the salary for this period is 800 yuan a month with no bonus. after that period if we both feel satisfied, a formal contract would be signed.

person alpha:
when am i supposed to start working?

person beta:
next monday. bring your resume and diploma with you.

person alpha:
yes, i will. thank you, mr. white. goodbye!

person beta:
goodbye!

person alpha:
don't tell me you're pregnant again.

person beta:
i'm afraid so.

person alpha:
what do you think of this dress? do you think it suits me?

person beta:
sure. why don't you try it on? the fitting room is over there.

person alpha:
it's just the right size-a perfect fit! have you seen anything you like?

person beta:
i'm thinking about buying this sweater. i know it's june now, but it will be perfect for autumn and winter.

person alpha:
it looks too big for you, but i like the color and the material is good quality. is it on sale?

person beta:
yes, it's half price. it's supposed to be too large--that's the fashion.

person alpha:
i might get one too, but in a different color. i prefer light blue to white.

person beta:
there.it looks great, don't you think? i'm going to get these jeans as well. i need a new pair. i'm also going to buy this scarf ready for winter.

person alpha:
i'm getting this beret? doesn't it look cool? i'd like to get some jeans too, but i don't have enough cash on me.

person beta:
don't worry. i've got my credit card. you can pay me back later.

person alpha:
thanks! now i don't need to come back to the shop a second time.

person beta:
good morning. wilson association.

person alpha:
this is mr brown speaking. i'd like to speak to mr. thomas, please.

person beta:
i'm sorry, but mr.thomas left the office a few minutes ago.

person alpha:
that's bad! i've been trying to call him for the last ten minutes, but your line has been busy. will he be back soon?

person beta:
i'm afraid not. he's gone for the rest of the day.

person alpha:
is there anywhere i can reach him?

person beta:
i don't believe so. he's going out of town on business. may i take a message?

person alpha:
i have a business appointment with him for tomorrow morning at ten o'clock, but i'm afraid i can't make it.

person beta:
would you care to make another appointment?

person alpha:
unfortunately, i'm leaving town rather unexpectedly, and i may be gone for several days.

person beta:
i see. i can tell mr.thomas that you phoned.

person alpha:
thank you.

person beta:
bye-bye.

person alpha:
i see you have bought the latest copy of" beauty and fashion". are there any interesting articles in it?

person beta:
there's an interesting interview with a top fashion designer about the latest fashions. i enjoyed reading her thought. the" which?" section is very interesting this month. they tested facial cleaners. the article recommends" all clear" for effectiveness and price.

person alpha:
i like to take the tests that they print in this magazine.

person beta:
which tests do you mean?

person alpha:
you know. tests like" how jealous are you?" and" are you a fashion victim?"

person beta:
oh, i see. i like to do those tests, too, but i don't take them seriously.

person alpha:
of course not, but sometimes the results make you think about yourself and what you do. according to the jealousy test, i'm quite a jealous type of person. perhaps i need to control my jealousy.

person beta:
marry wang's office, this is marry.

person alpha:
hi marry, this is tom.

person beta:
how can i help you?

person alpha:
i need to see if we can get together today.

person beta:
put on the helmet, please.

person alpha:
do we need to put on the jackets too?

person beta:
you'd better, to protect your clothes. now please watch your step.

person alpha:
thank you. is the production line fully automated?

person beta:
well, not fully automated.

person alpha:
i see. how do you control the quality?

person beta:
all products have to go through five checks in the whole manufacturing process.

person alpha:
what's the monthly output?

person beta:
one thousand units per month now. but we'll be making 1,200 units beginning with october.

person alpha:
what's your usual percentage of rejects?

person beta:
about 2% in normal operations.

person alpha:
that's wonderful. is that where the finished products come off?

person beta:
yes. shall we take a break now?

person alpha:
excuse me. may i take you a picture?

person beta:
with pleasure.

person alpha:
thanks you. shall we stand a bit further? i would like to take the tower in.

person beta:
no problem.

person alpha:
that's ok. if you want the photo i will mail it to you.

person beta:
no need, sir.

person alpha:
hello. this is the directory assistance. can i help you?

person beta:
can you give me the number for jessica hanson on locks ave?

person alpha:
i'm sorry. there is no listing under that name. are you sure of the name?

person beta:
yes, i'm pretty sure.

person alpha:
do you have her address?

person beta:
yes, i do. it's 109 locks ave, l8v 4n9.

person alpha:
that's an unlisted number. i'm sorry, but i can't give it to you.

person beta:
i see. thanks anyway.

person alpha:
no problem.

person beta:
i'd like to open a savings account. can you tell me how to do it?

person beta:
i believe your corporation will try your best and i understand fully your feeling, if your tender conditions proved be suitable for our general conditions of tender, we will accept your submission of tender.

person alpha:
fine, thanks a lot. bye!

person beta:
bye!

person alpha:
good morning, mr zhang, i wonder whether you have got an answer from your superior.

person beta:
yes, we had a meting about it yesterday afternoon.

person alpha:
what's the answer?

person beta:
we decided that we could agree to your price, but we are a bit worried about the slow delivery.

person alpha:
let me see. i quoted your delivery in three months, didn't i?

person beta:
yes, but we hope that the wool could reach us as soon as possible.

person alpha:
i thought you would be worried about it. so i rang auckland last night. as you are our biggest customer, they agreed to ship the order on the first vessel available that will leave auckland next month.

person beta:
good, if you agree we'll draft the agreement right away and sign it then.

person alpha:
by all means.

person beta:
be careful. the floor is wet.

person alpha:
what happened?

person beta:
i spilled my drink.

person alpha:
hello, this is lucie jing calling from lincoln bank. may i speak to mr was, please?

person beta:
speaking.

person alpha:
ah, hello, mr was. i'm just calling about your new credit card. it has arrived with us, so you can either come to collect it, or we can send it on to you.

person beta:
sending it won't be necessary. i'm actually coming in for a meeting with my personal banker this afternoon.

person alpha:
what perfect timing!

person beta:
indeed. is there anything i need to do before i collect it?

person alpha:
not really. but we do recommend you to read through our terms and conditions again before you sign the card, just in case there is something you aren't happy with.

person beta:
i'm sure it'll be fine. how about my pin number?

person alpha:
that will be sent on to you within 2 working days. then, you can start using your new card.

person beta:
great. i'll be in later today. thanks for calling. bye.

person alpha:
what are we eating for lunch?

person beta:
i have no idea. what about you?

person alpha:
i kind of want pizza.

person beta:
i ate pizza the other day.

person alpha:
so, what do you feel like eating then?

person beta:
how about some burgers?

person alpha:
i already had a burger yesterday.

person beta:
what are we going to do?

person alpha:
we can just each get what we want to get.

person beta:
that sounds like a plan.

person alpha:
do you know a place that sells pizza and burgers?

person beta:
i think they sell both at the cafeteria.

person alpha:
did you bring your certificate for nursing?

person beta:
yes, here is my certificate of nurse.

person alpha:
how about your nursing education?

person beta:
i learnt nursing through theory and practice for 3 years at hunan nursing school.

person alpha:
can you manage english conversation?

person beta:
yes, pretty well. i have started learning english since primary school.

person alpha:
have you ever thought about having children, kaitlyn?

person beta:
my husband and i have thought about it, but we've decided not to have any. they're just too expensive. besides, with all the news about global warming on the news lately, who knows what kind of worl

person alpha:
well, i've always wanted to have lots of children. growing up with only one brother, i always felt a bit lonely. what do you think about families with only one child?

person beta:
for me, growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention. i always wanted to be an only child so that i could always do what i wanted and so that i wouldn't ever have to share.

person alpha:
don't you think you would miss having other people around?

person beta:
no way! i spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7. you know, i don't think i've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents'home. what do you think fo the one-child policy

person alpha:
if china didn't have such a policy, can you imagine how many people there would be in china now?

person beta:
that's true. but as a woman, i'm glad that even though i don't want any children, i at least have a choice in how many children i have. on the other hand, i can't imagine what china would be like

person alpha:
do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child?

person beta:
i don't know what other people think, but i, for one, envy only children!

person alpha:
ok, let's go through this one more time. i don't want anymore ruined or dyed blouses!

person beta:
i know, i know. ok, so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine.

person alpha:
right. you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing. for example for delicates, you should set a shorter washing cycle. also, be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing.

person beta:
so complicated! ok, what about this red wine stain? how do i get it out?

person alpha:
since this is a white t-shirt, you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick.

person beta:
cool. then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it's all set right?

person alpha:
no! since you are washing delicates and cotton, you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes.

person beta:
you know what? i'll just have everything dry cleaned.

person alpha:
is tom in?

person beta:
no, he is at work now.

person alpha:
may i have his office phone number please?

person beta:
sure. it's 289,1234.

person alpha:
what about driving to shanghai?

person beta:
driving? no way, it's too far.

person alpha:
i just thought it would be an interesting way to see lots of places. how long will it take?

person beta:
too long, and you do not have much time.

person alpha:
what a pity.

person beta:
good afternoon. i'll show you to your room.

person alpha:
thank you.

person beta:
could you tell me which bags are yours?

person alpha:
they're over there next to the door. those three with green tags on them.

person beta:
could you wait a moment? i have to get a trolley. may i see your room key, please?

person alpha:
sure, here it is.

person beta:
thank you. room 402. you're on the 4th floor. this way, please.

person alpha:
excuse me, sir. is there anything i can do for you?

person beta:
yes. i bought the can two days ago, but today i found that is beyond the guarantee period.

person alpha:
let me see. i am sorry, sir. we will change another one for you. please wait a moment.

person beta:
excuse me, but could you tell me the way to the railway station?

person alpha:
the railway station? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner. the station is at the end of that street.

person beta:
how long will it take me to get there?

person alpha:
it's about a ten-minute walk.

person beta:
that's very clear. i think i can find my way now. thank you.

person alpha:
not at all.

person beta:
excuse me! does this bus go to the railway station?

person alpha:
no, you're got on the wrong bus. you can take a no. 22 bus at the university station and then transfer to a no. 83 bus at the railway station.

person beta:
ok! thank you very much!

person alpha:
i have here our price sheet on a f. o. b. basis. the prices are given without engagement.

person beta:
good, if you'll excuse me, i'll go over the sheet right now.

person alpha:
take your time.

person beta:
i can tell you at a glance that your prices are much too high.

person alpha:
i'm surprised to hear you say so. you know that the cost of pro- duction has been skyrocketing in recent years.

person beta:
we only ask that your prices be comparable to others. that's reasonable, isn't it?

person alpha:
well, to get the business done, we can consider making some concessions in our price. but first, you'll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us, so that we may adjust our prices accordingly.

person beta:
the size of our order depends greatly on the prices. let's settle that matter first.

person alpha:
well, as i've said, if your order is large enough, we're ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent.

person beta:
when i say your prices are much too high, i don't mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent.

person alpha:
how much do you mean then? can you give me a rough idea?

person beta:
to have this business concluded, i should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help.

person alpha:
impossible. how can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent?

person beta:
i think you are as well- informed as i am about the market for chemical fertilizers. it's unnecessary for me to point out that sup- ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet. may i suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say?

person alpha:
very well, i will.

person beta:
excuse me, you look lost.can i help you?

person alpha:
oh, thank you. i'm looking for the train station.

person beta:
right. let me see. you go straight down here and turn right.

person alpha:
right? ok, got it.

person beta:
then take the next left then the next right. are you with me?

person alpha:
next left then right? ok.

person beta:
i'm sorry, but i didn't catch what you said.

person alpha:
i said,'do you want me to help you?'

person beta:
i'm trying to find a post office.

person alpha:
go three blocks and turn right. it's right there.

person beta:
should i take the bus?

person alpha:
no. it'll only take about five minutes to walk.

person beta:
thank you very much.

person alpha:
anytime.

person beta:
it says here that you graduated from beijing normal university with a major in english language and literature.

person alpha:
right. then you may think that i am not fit for this job according to my educational background.

person beta:
yes.

person alpha:
but i want to be a tour guide very much because i like traveling and meeting various kinds of people. so i took an evening course at the tourism school of beijing after graduation and i have gotten a qualification certificate.

person beta:
so you must be an extravert?

person alpha:
yes, i always enjoy being with a group of people and chatting with them.

person beta:
what do you think are the responsibilities of a tourist guide?

person alpha:
a tourist guide must be responsible for arranging and coordinating tour activities, and offering service of transportation, accommodation, sightseeing, shopping and entertainment.

person beta:
don't you consider it a hard work?

person alpha:
hard but interesting, i think.

person beta:
have you any experience as a tourist guide?

person alpha:
yes, i usually guided foreign tourists around beijing when i was in university.

person beta:
have you ever learned any other foreign languages other than english?

person alpha:
yes, i have learned a little french and japanese as well.

person beta:
didn't you punch in this morning, monica?

person alpha:
sorry, i don't know the rule about punching.

person beta:
that's ok. i should have told you earlier. this is a company rule.

person alpha:
do we also need to punch out after work?

person beta:
according to the company rule, we should punch in before 8 o'clock and punch out after 5 o'clock every work day.

person alpha:
how about the lunch break, lucy?

person beta:
from 11 thirty to 1 o'clock.

person alpha:
may i ask whether we need to work overtime?

person beta:
sometimes, but not quite often.

person alpha:
this needs dry-cleaning.can you remove this stain without harming the fabric?

person beta:
let me see. we'll try, but i'm not sure that we can remove it.

person alpha:
ok, then. we'll i'd also like to have this pressed.

person beta:
any starch?

person alpha:
no starch.

person beta:
what's the problem?

person alpha:
i have a laceration on my left forearm.

person beta:
let me have a look. how did this happen?

person alpha:
i got hit by a car in an accident.

person beta:
was there much bleeding afterward?

person alpha:
no, not much.

person beta:
well, this doesn't look too serious. nurse, could you please get me a suture set?

person alpha:
will i need stitches?

person beta:
yes. three, i think. it wont'be too painful. alright, we're done. that wasn't so bad, was it?

person alpha:
no, not really.

person beta:
you're lucky there was no lasting damage. i'll set up an appointment for you to come back in five days. we'll take those stitches out then. so long.

person alpha:
thank you, doctor. bye.

person beta:
what time is it?

person alpha:
ten to nine.

person beta:
your watch is ten minutes slow. so it's should be nine sharp. i'm gonna be late again. what will be my excuse this time? it should be set the alarm for seven thirty.

person alpha:
don't cry over spilled milk, fred? could you stay with me a few minutes?

person beta:
what? why? what's wrong with you?

person alpha:
i just hate being alone at home with nothing to do about listen to the clock ticking.it's so lonely and boring. my sickness makes it worse. when will i recover?

person beta:
you will be fine in the couple of month, just be patient. i've got to woke now, i'll be late.

person alpha:
you only care about your work.

person beta:
sorry, baby, you are everything to me. all i do just for our family.

person alpha:
stay just a few minutes longer, ok?

person beta:
ok, i'll leave at 9:15, is that all right?

person alpha:
yes.

person beta:
i'll spent more time with you in the future, dina.

person alpha:
thank you.

person beta:
canton hotel.

person alpha:
i'd like to reserve a double room. i will be arriving next monday, the 12th. my name is wilson.

person beta:
a double room for the 12th? the name is wilson?

person alpha:
yes, that's right.

person beta:
how long will you be staying?

person alpha:
three or four days, perhaps longer.

person beta:
very good, sir. we will be expecting you next monday, the 12th.

person alpha:
how is the result of your lab test?

person beta:
when it comes to that, i have a lot to say.

person alpha:
then say it.

person beta:
when i went back to my doctor to hear the results of my lab tests, i tried to keep a poker face even though i was scared to death. then you guess what he said.

person alpha:
that's just what i want to know.

person beta:
he told me the tests were negative and there was nothing wrong with me.

person alpha:
could you tell me something about your family?

person beta:
ok. there are five people in my family, father, mother, elder brother, younger sister and i.

person alpha:
are your brother and sister still in school?

person beta:
my brother has found his job and my sister is still in college.

person alpha:
what does your father do?

person beta:
my father is a middle school teacher.

person alpha:
what about your mother?

person beta:
my mother is a housewife.

person alpha:
are you married?

person beta:
i am not married yet and i live alone now.

person alpha:
do you need to support your family?

person beta:
no, my father and brother are doing that.

person alpha:
have you finished school?

person beta:
yes, i have already graduated.

person alpha:
i'm in heaven! a whirlpool dryer!

person beta:
i love them, too. let's move into the kitchen. wait until you see the refrigerator.

person alpha:
this is too good to be true.

person beta:
and the stove is brand new. you know how to use a gas stove, right?

person alpha:
yes. we've lived in taiwan for a while. i had a gas stove in the states, too.

person beta:
it's better for cooking chinese food. well, what do you think?

person alpha:
we love it. but we'd like to know about the neighbors.

person beta:
how's your new car?

person alpha:
perfect! couldn't be better.

person beta:
you made a good choice, then?

person alpha:
it's just what i want.

person beta:
no regrets?

person alpha:
i am really pleased with it.

person beta:
i am glad you are happy.

person alpha:
it's super.

person beta:
good afternoon, sir. you're here to see about a temporary loan, right? the loans we offer are for purchasing income-generating assets. is that what you require?

person alpha:
yes, that's exactly what i need. how about terms for these?

person beta:
well, we offer 60- day or 90- day loans. the balance of the loan is to be repaid in full by the end of the specified period.

person alpha:
is there any flexibility on that?

person beta:
unfortunately, not.

person alpha:
ok. in my position, i think the best way to go would be for the 90- day loan. that would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan.

person beta:
not a problem, sir. if you'd just fill out these forms, and of course with necessary clearance, we can get you the money right away.

person alpha:
mr. wang, i've had scheduled for your two days stay in shanghai. you can make some changes if it does not suit you.

person beta:
all right. please read it to me.

person alpha:
on friday morning, mr. wang, the director of shanghai research institute, will visit you at the hotel. in the afternoon, you will discuss some problems with mr. yang, vice manager of computer corporation.

person beta:
very good.

person alpha:
on saturday, you'll leave the hotel for sightseeing. miss lu will be your guide.

person beta:
oh, that's great.

person alpha:
hi, i would like to return this tv.

person beta:
sure, do you have the receipt?

person alpha:
yeah here you go. actually i also want to return this keyboard.

person beta:
ok. may i ask what is the reason for returning these products?

person alpha:
the tv flickers a lot when i am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear.

person beta:
i see, and what about the keyboard?

person alpha:
i spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work.

person beta:
i am sorry mam, but we can only exchange or refund defective products, we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages.

person alpha:
fine! i don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways.

person beta:
there are so many people that the tickets are all sold out!

person alpha:
luckily we got the last two.

person beta:
look, danny. the four great inventions!

person alpha:
gunpowder, compass, the paper making, and the printing.

person beta:
i really admire those who made such great inventions!

person alpha:
may, i don't see why they are great. they are just simple things.

person beta:
they look simple today. but they were milestones in their times.

person alpha:
milestones? may, you must be kidding.

person beta:
just think bill gates, those inventions are as important as the windows system.

person alpha:
well, i suppose the ancient inventors made a lot of money out of them.

person beta:
no, quite the contrary.

person alpha:
why? didn't you say that they were milestones?

person beta:
yes, but they went to the public without any patent protection.

person alpha:
well, their inventors were not as clever as bill gates.

person beta:
what can i do for you?

person alpha:
i need some medicine.

person beta:
for whom?

person alpha:
my wife. she suffers from a bad cold.

person beta:
what symptoms does she have?

person alpha:
fever and a bad cough.

person beta:
i see. don't worry, just a common cold.

person alpha:
what kind of medicine does she need?

person beta:
patulin will be enough.

person alpha:
how many pills for each time?

person beta:
nine pills per day, and three pills after each meal.

person alpha:
thank you very much.

person beta:
it's my pleasure.

person alpha:
do you believe in god?

person beta:
not at all. i'm an agnostic. do you?

person alpha:
i'm not sure. why don't you believe there is a god?

person beta:
i think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one.

person alpha:
i basically believe in science over theology. i mean, i believe in evolution for example. however, there are many things that science hasn't explained yet.

person beta:
i'm sure that science will explain everything eventually. i think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong.

person alpha:
for example?

person beta:
religions preach tolerance, but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics.

person alpha:
yes. such people don't appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs.

person beta:
didn't you say your friend was american? where is she going on her honeymoon?

person alpha:
they're going skiing in colorado.

person beta:
what a coincidence! these pajamas would be perfect to take along on the honeymoon!

person alpha:
you're probably right. oh, what the heck! i'll take it all... in maroon, like you said.

person beta:
what a terrible house!

person alpha:
i'm sick of it, too.

person beta:
the door bell doesn't work, there's no hot water, and the building is falling apart.

person alpha:
it's no use complaining. if we had got enough money, we couldn't put up with it, and would have moved out.

person beta:
sure.

person alpha:
hello!

person beta:
is that sue?

person alpha:
speaking.

person beta:
a.this is george.

person alpha:
hello, george.what's up?

person beta:
this website offers very convenient air tickets booking service. it is quick and accurate.

person alpha:
yes, i once booked there. they give the immediate confirm information and flight information to both your mobile phone and e-mail. you can conveniently pay by credit card, so the whole transaction only takes a couple of minutes. they also provide e-tickets, meaning you don't need to go to any office to pick an air ticket. you go to the airport directly and check in with your id card.

person beta:
so it has attracted more and more customers these days.

person alpha:
yes, therefore they are expanding the scope of their service. for example, hotels can be booked through the same site as well.

person beta:
excuse me.

person alpha:
hello sir, may i help you?

person beta:
yes. can i see that t-shirt on the top shelf please?

person alpha:
sure. here it is.

person beta:
how much does it cost?

person alpha:
50 dollars.

person beta:
50 dollars. that's too much.

person alpha:
how about this one? it's on sale for only 35 dollars.

person beta:
i don't like that one.

person alpha:
how about the one next to the black gloves? it's very similar to the one you like.

person beta:
that's nice. how much is it?

person alpha:
30 dollars.

person beta:
that'll be fine.

person alpha:
is this color ok, or would you like a different color?

person beta:
that blue one's fine.

person alpha:
do you need any more of these shirts?

person beta:
yes.

person alpha:
how many do you want?

person beta:
i'll take two more, a red one and a white one.

person alpha:
hello, this is li bo speaking.

person beta:
hi, i am liu ming. i am calling to tell you that i have got the job.

person alpha:
oh, that is wonderful. congratulations!

person beta:
i really feel grateful to you for your reference. they have mentioned this in the job interview.

person alpha:
don't mention it. i think that is because you have right qualifications and nice personality.

person beta:
thanks again. i will start on next monday. i am sure i will have good performance.

person alpha:
i agree.

person beta:
i am a student in cambridge university. i read your ad, i want to know something more about your room, please?

person alpha:
it's a big bedroom with a drawing room, facing a beautiful wood.

person beta:
is there a bathroom?

person alpha:
no, but there is one downstairs, which my daughter used some years ago.

person beta:
it sounds good. could i go and see it myself?

person alpha:
certainly, you're welcome anytime.

person beta:
see you later!

person alpha:
( after a while) good afternoon, mrs. smith. i called you just now.

person beta:
welcome! come in, please!

person alpha:
yes.

person beta:
this way please. your room is upstairs... here it is.

person alpha:
wonderful! a modest, comfortable room. ah, a beautiful window, through which i can see a beautiful scene, and hear the birds singing. how nice!

person beta:
yes, if you want to wash something, there is a separate lavatory room outside.

person alpha:
excellent! i like it! when can i move in?

person beta:
anytime you like.

person alpha:
ok.

person beta:
hello, this is dunlin. may i speak to mrs smith?

person alpha:
this is mrs smith. can i help you?

person beta:
i am calling to say thank you for the interview yesterday.

person alpha:
you are welcome. i am very impressed by your capability.

person beta:
is there anything i should do?

person alpha:
no, nothing. it's thoughtful of you to call me again.

person beta:
thank you. please call me at any time if you have any questions.

person alpha:
ok, i will. do you have any question?

person beta:
no, thank you. goodbye.

person alpha:
goodbye.

person beta:
hi there. welcome to lincoln corporate services. how can we help?

person alpha:
hi. i was wondering what kind of fixed asset loans you have? do you have fixed asset loans?

person beta:
yes, we do. you'll go through the acceptance application, then a first review, then an evaluation and examination and finally get approval. why don't you read through this brochure? it outlines all of the important aspects of the loan, the terms and conditions, etc.

person alpha:
that's a good idea, to familiarise myself with it. then, i'll be back if we decide to go ahead.

person beta:
there are many art craft items in this shop. i suggest you take your time, and you might find something you like.

person alpha:
that's what i am going to do.

person beta:
if you have any problem, please come to me.

person alpha:
i surely will. how much is this wood carving?

person beta:
you are an expert on it. that wood carving is very rare. but i'm so sorry. that is not for sell.

person alpha:
that's ok. is anything else recommended?

person beta:
do you have any special request?

person alpha:
i'd like to see some traditional arts.

person beta:
so that means you are shopping for presents?

person alpha:
yes, i'm just here to pick out some special presents for my foreign friends.

person beta:
actually, i think the paper-cuts is ok, because it is easy to carry and foreign friends are also interested in it. they think that is a miracle.

person alpha:
sounds good. i'll take paper-cut.

person beta:
i have collected different kinds of paper-cuts all over the country, you can pick the one you like best.

person alpha:
you collect them yourself? i think that you are just doing the wholesale.

person beta:
as a matter of fact, i open the shop because i'm interested in the arts. i spent lots of time doing research on the folk art of our country.

person alpha:
wow, you are the expert on it.

person beta:
operator. can i help you?

person alpha:
i'd like to make a person-to-person call to beijing, china. the number is 2135367 8, and i want to speak to mr. zhang.

person beta:
to mr. zhang in at 2135-3678?

person alpha:
yes, that's right.

person beta:
may i have your name and telephone number?

person alpha:
my name is luo gang, and the phone number is 513-3284.

person beta:
mr. luo, will you hold the line, please--- mr. luo, there is no zhang at that number. will you check the number again, please?

person alpha:
what the number i gave you, operator?

person beta:
it's 2135-3678.

person alpha:
oh, i'm sorry. should have been 2135-3668, not 3678. i've given you a wrong number.

person beta:
are you sure this time?

person alpha:
yes.

person beta:
ok. let me try again.

person alpha:
thank you.

person beta:
are there any special requirements on the project? and shall we talk around it in details?

person alpha:
yes, there're some samples in our office and you can take some to study it. besides, you see, in recent years, we've visited a diversity of factory buildings all over the world and we hope that our building is the perfect match of advanced technology and attractiveness.

person beta:
that's a good idea. we can improve our technology to meet your special need.

person alpha:
and please let white color dominate.

person beta:
ok! i've noted it down. and any others?

person alpha:
oh! i've almost forgot the location was transferred to the a county in the east of the city.

person beta:
i'll tell them.

person alpha:
well, the most important thing is that our company demand the quality be exactly the same as the sample which you'll take from the office on the third floor.

person beta:
please feel assured that we'll abide by our promise. and we'll do everything we can to ensure delivery.

person alpha:
thanks a lot. and i believe i'll have a good time working with you.

person beta:
i think so. bye!

person alpha:
bye!

person beta:
mr. black, i'd like to take some time off. i've been feeling exhausted these days.

person alpha:
that's no problem. let me see... you still have ten days annual leave left, is that right?

person beta:
yes. i was wondering if i could take another two weeks off.

person alpha:
that's long leave. how's your project coming along?

person beta:
the project i'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week. i'd like to take my leave from next monday on.

person alpha:
well, all right. but you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave.

person beta:
thank you, mr.black. there are no immediate projects coming up at the moment. mr.smith will be in charge during my absence. he is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients.

person alpha:
great! i hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed.

person beta:
i will. many thanks, mr.black.

person alpha:
did you ever get a parking ticket?

person beta:
only a few.

person alpha:
what's a few?

person beta:
i've gotten six, i think.

person alpha:
did you pay your fines?

person beta:
of course i have.

person alpha:
how much are the parking tickets?

person beta:
i think they're$ 130.

person alpha:
that's expensive.

person beta:
i just got a parking ticket.

person alpha:
you should probably pay the fine soon.

person beta:
i'm going to pay it today.

person alpha:
are you doing anything right now, diana?

person beta:
i am typing a report for the moment, mr. robbins. anything i need to do?

person alpha:
will you please cut it for a while and come in here to take a letter?

person beta:
is it urgent?

person alpha:
yes, this letter can't go into the mail any later than 5. it's about a contract.

person beta:
ok, i am coming.

person alpha:
please take a seat, diana. have you got your spare pens and pencils?

person beta:
yes, i have this time. but if i don't understand a word or a phrase when you are dictating, can i ask you halfway?

person alpha:
no, i'd prefer not. i don't want any interruptions every other minute, but you can ask me at the end of the letter.

person beta:
all right. i understand now. do you think i should leave a margin on every page wide enough for notes and amendments.

person alpha:
of course, diana. you'd better pay attention to the spelling when you type it.

person beta:
certainly i will, mr. robbins. by the way, may i use a window envelope?

person alpha:
yes, that's fine. now when you finish these, i want you to put these cards in alphabetical order, using the last names, and then make a list.

person beta:
you want the cards in alphabetical order using the last names?

person alpha:
right. and the last thing, we are going to clean the files out tomorrow. now let's begin.

person beta:
you're finally here! what took so long?

person alpha:
i got stuck in traffic again. there was a terrible traffic jam near the carrefour intersection.

person beta:
it's always rather congested down there during rush hour. maybe you should try to find a different route to get home.

person alpha:
i don't think it can be avoided, to be honest.

person beta:
perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work.

person alpha:
i think it's something that i'll have to consider. the public transport system is pretty good.

person beta:
it would be better for the environment, too.

person alpha:
i know. i feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city.

person beta:
taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well.

person alpha:
the only problem is that i'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car.

person beta:
well, when it's nicer outside, you can start biking to work. that will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides.

person alpha:
that's true. i could certainly use the exercise!

person beta:
so, are you going to quit driving to work then?

person alpha:
yes, it's not good for me or for the environment.

person beta:
that's really convenient. we were wondering if you could take a little off the rent, though.

person alpha:
i can take two thousand off. that'll make the rent twenty-eight thousand.

person beta:
that's great. every little bit counts. and we don't need the parking space. i guess we could rent it out.

person alpha:
sure, for at least three thousand per month.

person beta:
that'll bring the price down to twenty-five. that's the price we were shooting for.

person alpha:
i'm glad. now, there's a deposit fee of two month's rent.

person beta:
hello. i sent out my laundry yesterday.aren't they ready?

person alpha:
they'll be ready by this afternoon.

person beta:
oh, no! i'm leaving for japan at 11 this morning.

person alpha:
is that right? we're very sorry.

person beta:
i thought it was" the same day" service.anyway, please do hurry.

person alpha:
i'm afraid we can't return it by 11 o'clock.

person beta:
well, then, would you send it to japan, please?

person alpha:
yes, we'll do so.

person beta:
hello, welcome to lincoln bank. what can we do for you today?

person alpha:
i want to effect payment under an l/ c today.

person beta:
no problem. ok... just checking for you. ah, i'm afraid there aren't enough funds in your account to cover this transaction. what you can do is buy some us dollars, using local currency and we can credit your account with that amount.

person alpha:
that seems alright. what's the exchange rate like today? good or bad?

person beta:
it's not too bad today, actually. 828.23.

person alpha:
how can i help you, sir?

person beta:
i am here to have a discussion on your company's investment issue.

person alpha:
sorry, could you tell me your name?

person beta:
i am james pond from fam company and i am here to discuss it with nova.

person alpha:
do you have an appointment?

person beta:
yes, i did it yesterday. our meeting should be 2 pm.

person alpha:
i guess she forgot your meeting. she is attending an important meeting in the company. will you have a seat? may i leave a memo for her?

person beta:
thank you.

person alpha:
she will be back soon.

person beta:
excuse me. would you please make a suit with this material?

person alpha:
sure. may i take your measurements?

person beta:
please don't make it too tight. this is for autumn wear, so make sure you allow for a cardigan underneath.

person alpha:
i see, sir. can you come back for a fitting on the 10th, that's in a week's time?

person beta:
the 10th? i'm sorry, but you see i'm going to attend an international conference on the 11th. could you have the suit ready by the 8th, or at the latest, the 9th?

person alpha:
well, a business suit usually takes ten days'time. but in your case, we'll try to have it ready sooner. how about coming for your fitting on the 8th? then your suit will be ready for you on the 10th?

person beta:
that's fine, thank you.

person alpha:
good morning everyone. thank you for attending the meeting today. i'm sure you all have a copy of the agenda. so let's get started with the first issue.

person beta:
we're here today to present to you the results of our marketing research regarding the consumer behavior.

person alpha:
i would like to begin by introducing our foreign guests to our stuff on your left( right), we have mr. brown, who is vice president of sales. next to him is ms. arts, director of marketing for the atlas company. in the back row is dr. barolo, who is visiting from italy. thank you all for coming.

person beta:
i am glad to see everyone is here and on time. let's get started! susan, toss out some of your ideas.

person alpha:
it seems that many boys are fighting there.

person beta:
break it up! i will not permit fighting in this campus.

person alpha:
the air quality in this city is horrendous! the pollution levels were so high that we weren't supposed to go outside with a face mask again!

person beta:
exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment.

person alpha:
on top of that, there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs, which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city.

person beta:
as much as i love this city, i think i'm going to have to find a greener city to live in. living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health.

person alpha:
i know what you mean. however, there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming. if it's not the pollution, then it's the natural disasters, deforestation, or the greenhouse

person beta:
what is the greenhouse effect exactly?

person alpha:
it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature.

person beta:
i see, so it's similar to global warming?

person alpha:
they're related to one another, yes.

person beta:
i heard that some people in england are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live.

person alpha:
people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature, but it's not all good news. they've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well.

person beta:
people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations.

person alpha:
i think if everyone pitches in, the world will be a better place.

person beta:
would you like some cookies? i just made them.

person alpha:
thank you. yes, i would.

person beta:
these are chocolate, and those are almond-flavored.

person alpha:
i guess i'll try a chocolate one first.mmmm... this is delicious.are they hard to make?

person beta:
no, they're really quite easy. wait a minute, i've got the recipe right here.see... these are the ingredients, and then you just follow the directions.

person alpha:
that does look easy. i think i'll make some tonight.

person beta:
can i help you?

person alpha:
i'd like to buy a ticket to casablanca on flight us125 tomorrow.

person beta:
hold on, plese.it will take off at 14:00 tomorrow.the price is$ 110.

person alpha:
well, i want to stay under$ 100.

person beta:
i am sorry sir. we won't give any discount in busy seasons.the price is the same.

person alpha:
how do you use an atm card, billy?

person beta:
it's easy grandpa. insert you card into the machine here. then wait a moment. ok. now you enter your pin. it should have four numbers.

person alpha:
oh yes. i've got it written down here. just a minute.

person beta:
you really shouldn't write it down. you should memorise it. you can change it to a more convenient number if you like.

person alpha:
ok, i've entered my pin. there are several options on the screen. i guess i just choose which service i want, don't i?

person beta:
yes. choose the service you need to use. if you choose to withdraw money, the machine will ask you how much you want.

person alpha:
i can just enter the amount using the key, right?

person beta:
that's right. give the machine a moment to process you request. then take your money.

person alpha:
these machines aren't very difficult to use. in fact, i quite like them. they are much faster than dealing with a band clerk.

person beta:
hello, is jennifer in?

person alpha:
i am sorry, you have the wrong number.

person beta:
oh, i am really sorry.

person alpha:
can you give me a hand with the dishes?

person beta:
sure. should i wash or dry?

person alpha:
i wash and you'll dry.

person beta:
ok. let's do it.

person alpha:
excuse me, do you have the latest issue of newsworld?

person beta:
yes, this week's issue just came in. here it is.

person alpha:
how about music madness?

person beta:

2,000 ad$.

person beta:
which would you like to remit, by mail or by cable?

person alpha:
what is the difference between them?

person beta:
the cable will take less time for your account, in the meantime, the regular service charge is also higher than that of the mail one.

person alpha:
well, i think the cable is better.

person beta:
ok, please fill in the application form giving the name and address of beneficiary, your name and telephone.

person alpha:

person beta:
everything is ok. the commission is 50 yuan.

person alpha:
no, i think it is very boring. can you change it to channel twelve, please?

person beta:
yes. oh, it's a talk show.

person alpha:

i'm sure you will like it.

person beta:

person beta:
it doesn't matter. i just want to have a relax and i don't care how far it is. can you tell me how to get there?

person alpha:
yes, take the greyhound bus. it will lead you directly there.

person beta:
thanks a billion.

person alpha:
every honored guests, welcome to hang thou. now we are visiting tiger-running spring.

person beta:
how can we relate tiger to this spot, miss zhang?

person alpha:
its name originates from a legend that two tigers run here and made a hole, and then a spring gushed out from it.

person beta:
how ignorant i am!

person alpha:
the longing tea and the tiger-running spring water are always considered as the" two wonders in west lake."

person beta:
i know that tea. it smells fragrant.

person alpha:
that's right. all my guests, attention please. we will have half an hour to visit the spring and take photos. and next spot will be the moon reflected in three pools.

person beta:
janice, david, come here. we take some photos here. i can't imagine how beautiful it is!

person alpha:
can i give you a hand?

person beta:
thanks.

person alpha:
you have been staying at home for several days. would you like to hang out with me?

person beta:
no problem. wait a moment.

person alpha:

person beta:
i'm afraid he's not in.

person alpha:
will you ask him to call me collect when he's back?

person beta:
certainly. may i ask who's calling, please?

person alpha:
yes, this is cindy wang of a& b trading company in new york.

person beta:
i'm afraid we can't increase salary this year, money is just too title.

person alpha:
i'm not sure i can't agree, dan

person beta:
why not?

person alpha:
surely, there are other ways to save money.

person beta:
what are you talking about, we tried everything!

person alpha:
i've got some great news for you!

person beta:
did you get the position you wanted?

person alpha:
yes, i'll be promoted to department manager.

person beta:
i'm glad to hear that. congratulations!

person alpha:

person alpha:
thank you very much.

person beta:
thank you for a lovely day. i really enjoyed it.

yes, i'd love to. thanks again. goodbye.

person alpha:
goodbye.

person beta:
hi, customer service desk. what can i do for you today, sir?

person alpha:
good morning. i bought this vacuum here a few months ago. it doesn't work now. can i return it or get it fixed?

person beta:
do you have your receipt with you?

person alpha:
yes, i do.

person beta:
when did you buy it from our store?

person alpha:
four months ago.

person beta:
i'm sorry. you can't return it because too much time has passed since you purchased it. in order to receive a refund, you must return merchandise to the store within 90 days of purchase.

person alpha:
but the direction book says i will get one-year warranty.

person beta:
yes, i know. after 90 days, you need to call the company that manufactured the vacuum to fix it because it's still under their warranty. their phone number should be in the direction book that came with your vacuum.

person alpha:
okay. i understand. i'll call the customer service office of the manufacturer. thank you.

person beta:
you're welcome.

person alpha:
excuse me, i'm looking for the alands morrissette album supposed former infatuation junkie.

person beta:
let's see. if we have it, it should be over there under m.( he looks through the cds.) hmm, it looks like we've sold out of that one, but we should be getting some more copies in soon. if you want, we can order it for you.

person alpha:

no problem.

person alpha:
excuse me. i'd like to check out, please.

person beta:
of course, sir. did you have anything from the minibar?

person alpha:
i am a graduate of a technical university and have been employed as a technician with company or approximately 10 years.

i see myself in a management position.

person beta:
this way, please. how do you like this one? it's made of cotton.

person alpha:
you have quite a range, haven't you? i would like to see some other styles.

person beta:
sorry, i overslept. my clock didn't go off this morning.

person alpha:
again?

person beta:
that's right, even though i did set the alarm last night.

person alpha:
your clock never works. perhaps you should buy a new one.

person beta:
well, if it breaks down again tomorrow, i'll definitely buy a new one.

person alpha:
i was really glad to hear about your award. congratulations!

person beta:
thanks, denise. actually, i was really surprised. i mean, there were a lot of qualified people out there.

person alpha:
sure. but the work you did was really exceptional! you definitely deserved it!

person beta:
thanks a lot. i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon, too. you've been doing some great work!

person alpha:
could you tell me where you put all the pots and pans?

person beta:
they're in the cabinet next to the sink.

person alpha:
where do you keep the dishes, baker?

person beta:
they're in the cabinet above the dishwasher.

person alpha:
and the forks and spoons?

person beta:
they're in that drawer.

person alpha:
ok, i know. would you please help me clean the kitchen?

person beta:
no problem.

person alpha:
oh hi, linda, this is todd.

person beta:
yes, todd, how nice to hear your voice!

person alpha:
linda, i just wanted to say that i had a wonderful evening with you last friday.

person beta:
i really enjoyed our evening together, todd.

person alpha:
i had fun also and was wondering if you would like to go hiking with me in the mountains on saturday.

person beta:
hiking would be perfect! may i bring along a picnic lunch for us to share?

person alpha:
a picnic lunch would be a nice thing to have along.

person beta:
i'll work on the lunch, and you can work out the details of where we will go. what time will you be at my house?

person alpha:
nine would be good, don't you think?

person beta:
nine is good. see you on saturday!

person alpha:
can i help you?

person beta:
i need some stamps for this letter.

person alpha:
what kind of stamps do you want?

person beta:
how much do i need for this letter?

person alpha:
i must weigh it first. err... it's five grams over weigh, do you want to send it as an ordinary or registered letter?

person beta:
i want it registered. how much is it then?

person alpha:
registration plus overnight... err... seven dollars in all.

person beta:
here's a 10- dollar bill.

person alpha:
now, your receipt, and the change.

person beta:
thanks. good-bye.

person alpha:
do you want to know what really motivates vince to be nice to me?

person beta:
ok. what?

person alpha:
it isn't gratitude. it's fear. vince is afraid i'll jump to a competitor.

person beta:
you wouldn't do that. would you?

person alpha:
i might. vince knows he needs to keep me happy.

person beta:
what about your accounts?

person alpha:
may i help you?

person beta:
yes, i am wondering if i can join the sightseeing tour in your hotel.

person alpha:
of course. how many people are there in your party?

person beta:
4 persons altogether.

person alpha:
ok, i will arrange it for you.

person beta:
thank you. put the charge on my bills, please.

person alpha:
good afternoon. is this the roley hotel?

person beta:
yes, madam. may i help you?

person alpha:
yes. i'm calling from westwood and westwood attorneys. i need to make a reservation for mr. alex brent.

person beta:
fine, madam. when will mr. brent be arriving, and how many nights will he be staying?

person alpha:
it's a lovely day out today, isn't it?

person beta:
it's beautiful. enjoy it while it lasts. it's supposed to get cold tomorrow.

person alpha:
what's the weather forecast for tomorrow?

person beta:
it's supposed to snow early tomorrow morning and then tomorrow afternoon there's a chance of freezing rain.

person alpha:
that doesn't sound pretty.

person beta:
do you have any plans for tomorrow?

person alpha:
well, i was going to drive to birmingham to see some friends.

person beta:
you might want to change your plans. with the cold and wet weather that we're supposed to have tomorrow, the roads are going to be rather slippery.

person alpha:
i suppose i should. i don't like driving in dangerous weather conditions. do you have any plans for tomorrow?

person beta:
i just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon.

person alpha:
if you're lucky, it'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day!

person beta:
if that happens, then i'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies.

person alpha:
that sounds like fun.

person beta:
hey, look outside! it's started to drizzle!

person alpha:
english weather is even more predictable than i had previously thought.

person beta:
can you tell me what's included in your warranty?

person alpha:
certainly. the product has a two-year guarantee. if it breaks down during that period we offer a replacement unit completely free of charge. our products are very reliable but we recommend you take out an extended warranty. this covers you for a further two years.

person beta:
i see. what does that include?

person alpha:
it covers all parts and labour, except for normal wear and tear of course.

person beta:
what sort of response time do you guarantee?

person alpha:
our engineers are on call 24 hours a day. we guarantee someone will be with you within four hours, but in practice it's often much sooner.

person beta:
are there any exclusions?

person alpha:
not really. it's a very comprehensive warranty. i'll put a copy in the post to you and you can read through the small print.

person beta:
do you have any particular conditions that you would like our company to take into consideration?

person alpha:
no, nothing in particular.

person beta:
all right. if we decide to hire you, we'd pay you two thousand and five hundred yuan a month at the start. you can have saturdays and sundays off. besides, you may have a paid month holiday every year. how do you think about it?

person alpha:
as regards salary, i leave it to you to decide after experience of capacity.

person beta:
well, we'll give you our decision in a couple of days. it's a pleasure to talk to you, mr. liu.

person alpha:
thank you, mr. white. i really appreciate your assistance.

person beta:
did you ever buy food from the snack stands near our hotel?

person alpha:
yes, several times.

person beta:
how do you like them?

person alpha:
not bad.

person beta:
i always have the temptation to eat something there.

person alpha:
then, why didn't you do that?

person beta:
i don't know how much we can trust them. do you have any ideas?

person alpha:
some of them, i think, are not good.

person beta:
it doesn't taste good?

person alpha:
no, i mean some of them are not clean enough.

person beta:
that's my greatest concern. but how can you tell which one is clean?

person alpha:
i judge by appearances.

person beta:
i got it. i think it's worth trying.

person alpha:
it certainly is.

person beta:
i'd like to try some kebab, roasted squid, and many different appealing things.

person alpha:
don't try everything at one time, please.

person beta:
i see. thank you.

person alpha:
i need my minibar restocked.

person beta:
everything is gone, sir?

person alpha:
there's not a drop left of anything.

person beta:
is there anything in particular you want?

person alpha:
yes, the perrier and the jim beam hit the spot. let me have three more of each.

person beta:
got it. anything else?

person alpha:
i really liked the apples. bring me a couple of apples, please.

person beta:
not a problem. anything else?

person alpha:
oh, yes, one more thing

person beta:
someone will be up shortly with your order, sir.

person alpha:
i will travel to southeast asia this summer, so i need to exchange some us dollars. can i get the foreign currency at any bank?

person beta:
i don't think you can. in china, our currency is not freely convertible yet.

person alpha:
do you mean there is no way to get any foreign money?

person beta:
no. you can go to the bank of china to exchange some us dollars at the current exchange rate of the day you exchange them. the maximum amount you can exchange is$ 2,000.

person alpha:
only$ 2,000? are there any other ways to get the money exchanged?

person beta:
the only official way is to go to bank of china.

person alpha:
i'd better take more dollars with me. it seems that i need to borrow some from my friends.

person beta:
can you squeeze me in sometime today?

person alpha:
that's a big order, jane. i am really swamped.

person beta:
i know what you're saying, but i have to go over the books with you before i go see our tax guy.

person alpha:
right. okay, let me see what i can do. how about 1:30 right after my lunch meeting? it won't take more than a half hour, will it?

person beta:
you seem to be upset. what's eating you?

person alpha:
it's because of my son. dick keeps getting on my nerves

person beta:
dick? how come? he used to be as meek as a lamb.

person alpha:
yes, he used to be. but now he's drifting off track.

person beta:
he must have been in bad company, or he wouldn't be off the beans.

person alpha:
bring me some toast, please.

person beta:
would you like butter or jam on your toast or do you just want it plain?

person alpha:
spread some jam, please.

person beta:
anything to drink?

person alpha:
black coffee is fine.

person beta:
peter, it's time to get up.

person alpha:
ten more minutes, mom.

person beta:
what time is it now?

person alpha:
it's already 3 8 o'clock.

person beta:
well, honey, wake up, or you'll be late for school.

person alpha:
shall we dance?

person beta:
sure. i suppose you dance much.

person alpha:
oh. no as a matter of fact, i haven't danced for a long time.

person beta:
but i can see you dance wonderfully well.

person alpha:
thanks for flattering me. i think you dance much right?

person beta:
no, just occasionally

person alpha:
oh, i like this music very much, let's tango.

person beta:
i'm afraid i can't dance well.

person alpha:
well, it's illegal to bring food and drinks into the theater.

person beta:
too bad. i did anyway.

person alpha:
no wonder you brought such a big bag today.

person beta:
i brought strawberry sticks. see?

person alpha:
those are the ones that are pre-dipped in sweet coating!

person beta:
yep. and there's real strawberry chunks in the coating.

person alpha:
i think that you look very cute today.

person beta:
is that right? this is a brand new outfit.

person alpha:
what store did you get it from?

person beta:
i went to macy's and picked it out.

person alpha:
i love your outfit right now.

person beta:
well, i think you look nice today too.

person alpha:
thanks. i found these new shoes earlier at the store.

person beta:
i think that those are some really nice shoes. what kind are they?

person alpha:
these are chucks.

person beta:
your shoes look really nice. how much did you get them for?

person alpha:
they only cost me about forty dollars.

person beta:
i'm going to go get a pair for myself.

person alpha:
what can i do for you?

person beta:
i'd like to be waken up tomorrow morning.

person alpha:
ok sir. at what time?

person beta:
well, how long is it from here to the train station?

person alpha:
if you take a taxi, it will be 20 minutes.

person beta:
then please wake me up at 7: oo.thank you.

person alpha:
ah, ah, ah...

person beta:
all right, bill.here's your daily exercise schedule. you are to jog before breakfast.

person alpha:
jog?

person beta:
then, you are to walk to work.

person alpha:
walk?

person beta:
thirty minutes in gym at lunch time.

person alpha:
oh no.

person beta:
use the stairs, never the elevator.

person alpha:
oh, dear.

person beta:
and three times a week, you can either swim, play racketball, or hand ball.

person alpha:
oh no.

person beta:
ok, you can stop now.it's time for the dance class.

person alpha:
dance class! i don't know how.

person beta:
you will.

person alpha:
oh...

person beta:
i have a reservation. my name is john sandals.

person alpha:
may i see your id, please, mr. sandals?

person beta:
certainly. here it is.

person alpha:
thank you. do you have a credit card, mr. sandals?

person beta:
yes, i do. do you accept american express?

person alpha:
sorry, sir, just visa or mastercard.

person beta:
okay. here's my visa card.

person alpha:
okay. you're in room 507. it's a single queen-size bed, spacious, and nonsmoking. is that suitable?

person beta:
yes, it sounds like everything i expected.

person alpha:
here's your key, sir. if you need anything, just dial 0 on your room phone.

person beta:
sandy, can you help me contact these people?

person alpha:
sure, what do you want me to tell them?

person beta:
well, i need to confirm the time of their classes.

person alpha:
ok, where can i find their telephone number?

person beta:
they are all listed here on this sheet of paper.

person alpha:
is it their home, office or cell phone numbers?

person beta:
unless it's marked differently, it's their home numbers.

person alpha:
alright. what if i can't get a hold of them by phone?

person beta:
then, you should e-mail them with the information.

person alpha:
where can i find their e-mail addresses?

person beta:
they should have then listed on their resumes.

person alpha:
and if there aren't any e-mail addresses?

person beta:
then send them a sms on their cell phone.

person alpha:
ok. that sounds easy enough. have you called any of them yet?

person beta:
yes. i called the first three people on the list, but they didn't pick up.

person alpha:
did you leave a voice message?

person beta:
i left a voice message on one---just for the first person on the list.

person alpha:
i see. what did you tell her?

person beta:
i told her that she should call me back at my office number.

person alpha:
ok, so, maybe i should call her again.

person beta:
yes, that sounds like a good idea. she might not get the other message in time.

person alpha:
one more question. it looks like some of these numbers are long-distance. do you have a calling card that i can use to get through to them?

person beta:
sure. you can use this one. the pin number is written on the back of the card.

person alpha:
alright. thanks a lot. don't worry. i'll take care of it.

person beta:
great work. i'm off for the weekend! see you on monday.

person alpha:
see you.

person beta:
how long does it take to get to downtown from here?

person alpha:
it is 15 minutes'drive.

person beta:
what companies do we have in our neighborhood?

person alpha:
mitsubishi, hp, ibm and many other famous corporations.

person beta:
does the 7th floor belong to our company too?

person alpha:
yes, our company has two floors, the 6th and 7th floor in this building.

person beta:
it's such a large firm. do we have our own staff restaurant?

person alpha:
yes, at the end of the hall.

person beta:
we came too early. there're still three hours before the performance starts.

person alpha:
i know. sorry, i shouldn't have rushed you, but i just couldn't stay at home and wait.

person beta:
never mind. what about taking a look around the theater?

person alpha:
why not? i'd love to do that.

person beta:
here we go. there is a museum of the beijing opera art.

person alpha:
wow. look at this. so delicate and beautiful. did ancient chinese people really wear them?

person beta:
not really. they are just opera costumes. do you like the embroidery?

person alpha:
i surely do. they must have had advanced machine in ancient china to do that.

person beta:
no, no, no. they are all handmade, girl. you know, the ancient chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework.

person alpha:
unbelievable! i could never do that.

person beta:
good morning. can i see mr jackson, please?

person alpha:
well. have you got his permission?

person beta:
yes. we have an appointment at eight o'clock.

person alpha:
what's your name, please?

person beta:
robert. philips robert.

person alpha:
the environment varies greatly because of difference in language, customs and traditions.

person beta:
yes. this gap can be filled by export market research before exporting.

person alpha:
but the importance of the export research is often neglected by the managers.

person beta:
that's right. they do not appreciate its value and consider it to be a luxury.

person alpha:
therefore, when enterprises are spending a lot of money in trying to penetrate a new market, they should research whether their products can be sold at high enough a price and in a satisfactory amount.

person beta:
exactly!

person alpha:
hello, i really appreciate the opportunity to interview for this position.

person beta:
i was wondering if you like team projects, or projects that you work on alone.

person alpha:
i like to work on group projects that value and need each individual's contributions.

person beta:
are you most interested in a good steady job with benefits or one that will allow you to quickly advance?

person alpha:
i have children so a steady job is important but i would like a chance to advance.

person beta:
how would you feel about relocating to another state?

person alpha:
i could not relocate in the next year, but might be open to it in the future.

person beta:
do you know how much this job offers per year?

person alpha:
a minimum of 75,000 per year.

person beta:
ok, well, that's all i need to know for now. if something comes up, we'll be contacting you.

person alpha:
hello, could i speak to allison, please?

person beta:
i'm sorry, he's out at the moment.

person alpha:
when do you expect him back?

person beta:
i think he'll be back in about an hour at least.

person alpha:
well, may i leave a message?

person beta:
yes, of course.

person alpha:
would you please ask him to call chris when he gets back?

person beta:
ok. does he know your number?

person alpha:
i'm afraid he doesn't. my mobile is 139- 2477- 4026.

person beta:
13924774026. all right. thanks for calling. oh, hang on, someone's at the door that may be him, please hold on.

person alpha:
i am sorry. i didn't accomplish the job on time.

person beta:
that's all right. everyone feels under the weather sometimes. just finish the rest when you feel well.

person alpha:
waiter!

person beta:
yes, can i help you?

person alpha:
where shall i pay the bill?

person beta:
you can pay here.

person alpha:
ok. how much is it all together?

person beta:
it is one hundred and fifty. this is your bill.

person alpha:
is the service charge included?

person beta:
yes.

person alpha:
ok, here you are.

person beta:
thank you.

person alpha:
good afternoon, madam. is there anything i can do for you?

person beta:
yes, i spent so much time sightseeing here. it is already so late now. i am afraid i can't catch the last bus back to downtown.

person alpha:
don't worry. i will try to get a taxi for you. you can take it to the bus station.

person beta:
i am very grateful to your help.

person alpha:
don't mention it. it is my duty.

person beta:
thanks again.

person alpha:
looks like dinner's ready.

person beta:
just about.

person alpha:
i'm done. can i watch tv?

person beta:
here's some water. take these multi-vitamins and tylenol.

person alpha:
uh! i can't swallow them, mom!

person beta:
your throat must be swollen.

person alpha:
do i have to take them?

person beta:
here, i'll break them up, so they're smaller. and here's some cough syrup.

person alpha:
yuck!

person beta:
i know, it tastes horrible. but it'll make you feel better. try holding your nose. it won't taste as bad.

person alpha:
hello, mary.

person beta:
oh, hello, tom! beautiful day, isn't it?

person alpha:
yes, it is!

person beta:
excuse me, is this the auto consumer loan center?

person alpha:
yes. is there anything i can do for you?

person beta:
could you tell me something about the terms and interest rates for personal automobile consumer loan?

person alpha:
the deadline is normally no more than 5 years with the interest adopted according to the corresponding lending rates announced by the pbc.

person beta:
i plan to take the loan for 3 years.

person alpha:
well, the yearly interest rate is 5.49% for 3 years. i'm sure you are qualified to apply for this loan.

person beta:
what about the loan repayment?

person alpha:
you may choose a repayment pattern by consulting with our bank, for example, payment of equal amount of principal or of principal and interest on monthly installments.

person beta:
does that mean i should deposit sufficient money to my account prior to the monthly payment date so that you can directly deduct the repayment of the principal and interest?

person alpha:
exactly. you are permitted to effect and early payment in part or in full with the consent of our bank.

person beta:
that's very thoughtful of you. thank you so much.

person alpha:
you're welcome.

person beta:
you really need to look at some of the problems we are having with the apartment.

person alpha:
that apartment never had any problems before. are you sure the problem isn't you?

person beta:
we spoke with you the first week we moved in about things that you promised to fix.

person alpha:
where do you think you have problems?

person beta:
there is no hot water, the bedroom has a broken window, and there are rats in the kitchen.

person alpha:
you know, no one else who has been in that apartment has had a problem before.

person beta:
you are obligated to maintain your building and my apartment.

person alpha:
i will fix these problems when i get around to it.

person beta:
i will be withholding my rent check this friday unless these problems are addressed immediately.

person alpha:
you can't do that! it's illegal!

person beta:
i can't believe these skirts are so cheap.

person alpha:
i know and they are really nice, too.

person beta:
i'll have to get a couple in different colors.

person alpha:
me, too.

person beta:
buy them now though, or they might not still be here tomorrow.

person alpha:
good idea, especially at this price.

person beta:
taxi!

person alpha:
yes, sir. where to?

person beta:
wangfujing, please!

person alpha:
all right.

person beta:
oh, i like the music on your radio. it's nice.

person alpha:
thank you! i always tune to this program when driving. so what's your favorite program?

person beta:
i like winner's english very mush. you know the beijing olympic games is right around the corner. we should learn english well. it's on fm 96.6, china business radio. you can get it on your radio too.

person alpha:
but i don't speak english at all.

person beta:
that's ok. the program is especially for the beginners like us.

person alpha:
really? when is it on?

person beta:
it begins at 6:40 every morning, and it goes for 20 minutes.

person alpha:
thank you so much. i'll try and catch that.

person beta:
the radio has brought us lots of convenience.

person alpha:
yes, i can also learn about the traffic condition through it.

person beta:
with the development of the society and technology, radio is nearly everywhere.

person alpha:
so we should take the advantage of it.

person beta:
i'm thinking about getting a pet, but i'm really not sure which animal would be suitable. could you give me some advice?

person alpha:
certainly! the first thing is to be honest about how much time for you can devote to your pet. dogs are very demanding. you need to take them for walks and they love to play. cats, on the other hand, are more independent.

person beta:
i'm fairly busy, so i really need an animal that i don't need to care of very much. actually, i'd like a pet that's a little unusual. i don't'really want a typical pet, like a cat, dog, or hamster. do you have any suggestions?

person alpha:
unusual pet are often more expensive to keep. is that a problem?

person beta:
not really. by the way, i don't want a pet that could be dangerous, like a tarantula or rattlesnake.

person alpha:
we have those, but i only sell them to people i know well, for obvious reasons. how about a lizard? i have some that are very brightly coloured, are not aggressive, and are easy to feed and look after.

person beta:
that sounds ideal. could you show me some?

person alpha:
sure. come over here. as you can see, i have a wide selection of species. they can live together, if you want lizards of different kinds. do you have a favourite colour?

person beta:
i like the red one. what do they eat?

person alpha:
you can feed them on various things. they will eat small pieces of meat, but i'd recommend insects. you can get them from your garden, but remember that lizards eat a lot insects. i sell them here.

person beta:
thanks a lot. what i'll do si find out more online and drop by next week.

person alpha:
that's fine. you shouldn't make a hasty decision when choosing a pet.

person beta:
i'd like to make sure my plane reservation is in order.

person alpha:
may i have your flight number, please?

person beta:
world airlines, flight 201.

person alpha:
and your name, please?

person beta:
john anderson.

person alpha:
yes, sir. you're booked on flight 201, leaving in one hour.

person beta:
thank you.

person alpha:
i really think if i can get my foot in the door at this company it will do wonders for my career. do you think you can help me polish my interview style?

person beta:
sure. doing your homework and preparing for an interview really pays off.

person alpha:
i've researched the company and think i'm perfect for the job but i'm not sure how to get it across to them.

person beta:
well first you have to have more confidence.employers look for people who are interested, enthusiastic and sure of themselves.

person alpha:
i know i have what it takes but im worried that my work experience won't sufficient. should i inflate my experience?

person beta:
no, you should always be upfront and honest about your weaknesses. however by focusing on your strong points and maintaining a positive attitude about your abilities, you can take the attention

person alpha:
after i am accepted for unemployment benefits, what will happen next?

person beta:
you will receive a notice of unemployment insurance award letter.

person alpha:
are there any other forms that i need to fill out?

person beta:

person alpha:
what information will i need to provide on that form?

person beta:
they will need to know where you worked and how much money you made.

person alpha:
are there any other questions on the form?

person beta:
basically, they want to know that you were available for work and not sick.

person alpha:
hello, i was wondering if i could talk with the apartment manager.

person beta:
i am the apartment manager. how can i help you?

person alpha:
i was wondering if the apartment on main street is still available.

i'm ready to place an order with you, but only one condition that the goods are confined to australia. can you do that?

well, i haven't made such arrangements with the factory yet. so i'd like to make sure if it is acceptable to the factory before making a commitment to you.

person beta:
all right, but i'm busy. how long will it be before you can finish the talk?

person alpha:
i won't be too long, i suppose. just let me ring them, will you?

person beta:
go ahead.

person alpha:
thank you.

holly? holly madison, is that you? you look great! you haven't changed a bit.

person alpha:

person beta:

person alpha:
i have a typical 9 to 5 job. actually, i work a little longer than 9 to 5 most days.

person beta:
do you get paid onetime?

person alpha:
no, i don't. i get a bonus each month, depending on the value of the contracts i sign with clients.

person beta:
do you have any breaks?

person alpha:
we have an hour-long lunch break form 12 to 1. we can take coffee breaks during the day. my boss doesn't mind, as long as we get out work done on time.

person beta:
my boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks. i suppose your job involves a lot paperwork, doesn't it?

person alpha:
that's wonderful, sir. now, here's your key. should you need anything, just dial 0.

person beta:
are you ready to order, madam?

person alpha:
i'm on a diet. so i have to avoid food containing too much fat. do you have vegetarian dishes?

so you're quite confident in your experience and skill

person alpha:
i think so.

person beta:
yes, sir.may i help you?

person alpha:
please i'd like a ticket to new york.

person beta:
for today?

person alpha:
no, early saturday morning.

person beta:
we have a flight that we'll put you there at ten am.is that ok?

person alpha:
well. we only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable l\ c, payable against shipping documents.

i got robbed.

person beta:
when did this happen?

person alpha:
it happened this morning.

person beta:
what was taken?

person alpha:
my wallet and cell phone.

person beta:
did you get a good look at the person who robbed you?

person alpha:
i sure did.

person beta:
would you able to pick him out of a line-up?

person alpha:
that shouldn't be a problem.

person beta:
dad, i'd like to borrow some money.

person alpha:
sure, johnny, how much do you need? five bucks?

person beta:
come on, dad, i need thirty thousand. i wanna get into the market. you know, i'm tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn, the inevitable recession, people stuffing their money in their mattresses. i look at this as an opportunity. this is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg.

person alpha:
i don't know about that.with all the uncertainty in the markets right now, it would be a very unwise decision to invest. i don't know if you're aware son, but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently. there have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months, and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy. there's just too much instability. i wouldn't feel comfortable investing in this climate.

person beta:
but look at it this way, every challenge is an opportunity.and anyway, i'm not talking about investing in the domestic market. there are emerging markets that promise great returns. look at china, for example.they have 1.4 billion people, half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class. here alone, the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity.

person alpha:
come on, son, you're looking at this too naively, the chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability, and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point.

person beta:
fine, then! if that's the way you feel, so be it. but you're losing out on a great opportunity here. i'm going to go hit up mum for the cash.

person alpha:
could you tell me a little about the organization? for example, how big is your workforce here?

person beta:
well in total we have around 150 employees based in hong kong with another 400 in our head office in beijing. the news desk staff in hong kong comprises around 80 staff.

person alpha:
i see. and how about the working hours?

person beta:
well, as you know rebecca, in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five. you could be on call at any time. we do have to work very unsociable hours at times.

person alpha:
well i am used to that, mr. parsons, so that's not really a shock for me.

person beta:
good, as long as you understand that.

person alpha:
and when do you need to fill the vacancy, mr. parsons?

person beta:
yesterday! but no, we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month.

person alpha:
that sounds ideal.

person beta:
smells good! what's for breakfast?

person alpha:
well, since we are getting up so late, i decided to make a big breakfast!

person beta:
nice! brunch!

person alpha:
kind of, so i made scrambled and soft boiled eggs, some french toast and buttermilk pancakes!

person beta:
wow! you really went all out! did you make any coffee?

person alpha:
yeah, just the way you like it! i also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light.

person beta:
looks good! i'll squeeze us some fresh orange juice.

person alpha:
get the jam and butter while you are in there! oh! and don't forget the syrup!

person beta:
come on, fellows. let's enjoy my wife's cooking!

person alpha:
em, it's delicious!

person beta:
thank you! my wife likes cooking very much.

person alpha:
you're lucky.

person beta:
our advertisement says english competence is a key requirement of this position. then how do you think of your proficiency in written and spoken english?

person alpha:
i have learned english for 10 years, and i have passed college english test band 4 and 6.my spoken english is fairly good enough to express myself fluently.

person beta:
what other foreign language do you speak?

person alpha:
i did self-study of japanese in college, and i can carry on some simple conversations in japanese.

person beta:
why did you apply for the position?

person alpha:
i learned from your ad.that you will provide on-the-job training for new employees.this is just what i need, because i'm a recent college graduate. i have the necessary knowledge and skills but i lack experience.

person beta:
what do you hope to become?

person alpha:
i want to prove my true value in the electronic industry, and hopefully in the near future i would be promoted to a higher position.

person beta:
well, thank you for coming.we'll let you know as soon as possible.

person alpha:
linda, would you care for some candies or cookies?

person beta:
no, don't try to tempt me. i'm becoming chubby, and i have to slim down.

person alpha:
you are not really chubby. you are actually thin enough.

person beta:
i don't think so. i know i've put on weight this winter.

person alpha:
so you are watching your weight, aren't you?

person beta:
yes, to tell you the truth. i am on a diet.

person alpha:
how about your grades of study?

person beta:
i had been doing quite well. in all subjects, i got excellent scores.

person alpha:
well. in that case, you must have got good records in english, too.

person beta:
yes, i was the top student among my classmates.

person alpha:
how about your oral english?

person beta:
quite well. i took the national english speaking contest in cctv 2008 and i got first place.

person alpha:
excuse me, i'd like to have these pants i bought here yesterday altered. here's my receipt.

person beta:
certainly, sir. what would you like done to them?

person alpha:
they're a little bit too long, so i'd like about half an inch taken off them.

person beta:
all right, sir. they should be ready for you by tomorrow afternoon.

person alpha:
thank you very much.

person beta:
it's our pleasure.

person alpha:
hi, doris. i hear you are going to the united states next week.

person beta:
so i am.

person beta:
it's valid for 5 years. i am planning to do a doctor's degree during my stay there.

person alpha:
good. good luck to you!

person beta:
thank you very much.

person alpha:
hi, how are you?

person beta:
it's nice to meet you. thanks for coming.

person alpha:
it's my pleasure.

person beta:
i wanted to meet with you to discuss your daughter.

person alpha:
is she acting up in class?

person beta:
not at all. she's a joy to have in my class.

person alpha:
is she really?

person beta:
she is absolutely wonderful.

person alpha:
so she isn't causing you any problems?

person beta:
no. she is actually very intelligent and well behaved.

person alpha:
i'm glad to know that you like her.

person beta:
you have nothing to worry about with her.

person alpha:
good afternoon, ladies. may i help you?

person beta:
can we have two adjoining double rooms, sir?

person alpha:
have you made a reservation, ladies?

person beta:
i'm afraid not.

person alpha:
one moment, please. i have to check if there are rooms available. i'm sorry, ladies. we have only two double rooms available but they are on different floors. would you mind that?

person beta:
we prefer on the same floor because we will probably chat late at night.

person alpha:
then may i suggest a family suite? we have just had a cancellation.

person beta:
what is it like?

person alpha:
it's a big room with a king-size double bed and two single beds. we could also add rollaways.

person beta:
that's great! how much is it?

person alpha:
two thousand hongkong dollars per night plus ten percent service charge and five percent government government tax.

person beta:
that's fine.

person alpha:
but ladies, the room is not yet ready. there will be a delay of about half an hour. perhaps you could fill in the registration form first, and then rest in our lobby for a while. we will let you know when the room is ready.

person beta:
alright, hanks.

person alpha:
nice to meet you, sir. i come from new times clothes company. we learnt that your exhibits on the trade fair in shanghai this month were marvelous. would you please quote the price?

person beta:
before we discuss the price, may i ask you what kind of exhibits you are interested in?

person alpha:
your summer clothes for white-collar and men's jackets.

person beta:
can you give us a rough idea of the quantity you require? it is generally known that the price varies according to the quantity.

person alpha:
that is to say, 10000 sets for the one of white-collar and 5000 for men's jackets.

person beta:
in that case, our offer for the white-collar series is us$ 200, and the other is us$ 300 per set.

person alpha:
do you quote cif or fob?

person beta:
we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent for you. you will find our price is most competitive.

person alpha:
what are your terms of payment?

person beta:
letter of credit at sight.

person alpha:
another question. could you tell me the earliest possible time of shipment?

person beta:
within a month after your letter of credit reaches us.

person alpha:
well, i got all the point. all the decision will be made since i get the approval from my supervisor.

person beta:
ok! i expect you to accept our general terms and conditions of trade. we believe that through our cooperation, large transactions will be brought to speedy conclusion.

person alpha:

person beta:
do you have any postcards?

person alpha:

person beta:
can i have one each?

person alpha:
sure. take as much as you want. they are free gifts from this shop.

person beta:
is there anywhere i can buy some more cards with beautiful scenery?

person alpha:
please try the shop there. they might have them.

person beta:
are their cards free, too?

person alpha:
no, their cards are for sale.

person beta:
so what do you think of my new dress?

person alpha:
i think it's great! i really like the color, and it goes really well with your eyes. i've actually been eyeing that dress at maxine's for a while now, but i wasn't sure i could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment.

person beta:
um, ninety-five dollars?

person alpha:
yes, that's the price they were advertising it at. i was hoping it might go on sale soon. why, how much did you pay for it?

person beta:
i bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at helen's boutique. i didn't know i could get it cheaper somewhere else.

person alpha:
of course! everything at helen's is overpriced, and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store! why didn't you shop around?

person beta:
i don't know, i just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much i wanted it. i guess i was too impulsive.

person alpha:
long time no see, george!

person beta:
yes, a very long time.

person alpha:
what brings you here?

person beta:
i'm here on vacation.

person alpha:
hello, this is abc corporation. may i help you?

person beta:
yes, i'm enquiring about your advertisement for a sales manager in today's newspaper. is this position still open?

person alpha:
yes, but do you have any experiences as a sales manager?

person beta:
yes, i have a lot of previous experiences in sales. i worked in sales departments for two companies since i finished my university.

person alpha:
that sounds fine. please give me your name and phone numbers. i'll set up an appointment for an interview for you. it will most likely be in a couple of days. is it all right for you?

person beta:
yes, my name is brian and my phone number is 5294870.

person alpha:

person alpha:
thank you very much.

person beta:
you're welcome.

person alpha:
what do you think of the project?

person beta:
very interesting. thank you for bringing it to us.

person alpha:
are you interested in making this investment?

person beta:
we haven't decided yet, we will let you know if we do.

person alpha:
david, how is your interview?

person beta:
i was nervous at that time. what about you?

person alpha:
just fine. i tried to answer every question raised by hr carefully. i found some answering skills are useful. these questions are different from exams.

person beta:
we can have a rest now after this tough interview.

person alpha:
don't be rush. it is suggested to write a letter for the personnel department of future clothes company.

person beta:
sounds like a good idea. and i think this can leave deep impression to hr. how can we write a suitable letter?

person alpha:
just to show your gratitude to the chance and tell them your impression on the company. and you can mention some details in your own interview to remind them of you.

person beta:
i am getting to know your meaning.

person alpha:
good morning, i made an appointment with dr. smith, but i have to change it.

person beta:
when you made your appointment, what day did you choose?

person alpha:
my appointment was on wednesday.

person beta:
at what time was that appointment?

person alpha:
it was for 4

person beta:
i can see the appointment that you had. what day do you need to change to?

person alpha:
i want to change to next tuesday.

person beta:
what time would you prefer?

person alpha:
i would prefer three o'clock in the afternoon.

person beta:
i will put you down for that time. thank you for calling to reschedule.

person alpha:
can i help you?

person beta:
en, i am looking for a porter, do you know where i can find one?

person alpha:
there are so many here.the men with red hats are the porters.

person beta:
what's the charge?

person alpha:
well, it depends how many pieces of luggages you have.

person beta:
thank you.

person alpha:
have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work?

person beta:
yes, not bad. like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it's showing your respect to your co-workers.

person alpha:
well, but for this one, don't bring your cell phone to meetings, i think it is not reasonable. what if there are some important calls?

person beta:
well, this one is not compulsory. it is just suggestion.

person alpha:
i didn't pay attention to that.

person beta:
do you think we should travel by bus or by train?

person alpha:
it's a difficult choice.the train is a little faster, but much more expensive.

person beta:
we could face delays if we travel by bus, thanks to traffic jams.

person alpha:
buses are more cramps and you can't walk around.

person beta:
that's true.but i feel that i see more when i travel by bus.

person alpha:
really? i think you see more traveling by train.

person beta:
so which form of transport do you prefer to use?

person alpha:
i prefer going by train, even though it costs more.

person beta:
ok, then we'll go by train. i'm sure we'll have a good journey.shall we go to the station and buy the tickets?

person alpha:
the trains aren't usually full.we can get them on the day we travel.we should buy return tickets, because they are much cheaper than getting 2 singles.

person beta:
we should take a packed lunch on the journey.the food they sell on the trains is always expensive.

person alpha:
did you hear about lulu?

person beta:
no, what?

person alpha:
she and vic broke up and now she's asked for a transfer.

person beta:
get out of here! i didn't even know they were dating!

person alpha:
no one really did. they were very discreet and professional at the office.

person beta:
here's a model of our latest design. what do you think of it?

person alpha:
well, i'm not too happy about it.

person beta:
what's wrong with it?

person alpha:
well, i'm afraid it's not at all what i wanted. you haven't really followed my instructions.it'll have to be done again.

person beta:
oh, dear!

person alpha:
hello, this is the international youth hotel. how can i help you?

person beta:
oh, yes. i want to check whether you still have any vacancies. i need three single rooms for next monday.

person alpha:
ok. there're vacancies. since the peak season is coming, it's advisable to book soon. would you like to make a reservation now?

person beta:
yes, please. do you take credit cards?

person alpha:
yes, we accept all major credit cards.

person beta:
and how about internet access?

person alpha:
there's free internet access in the lobby.

person beta:
is it available in the rooms?

person alpha:
unfortunately not.

person beta:
that's ok. is breakfast included?

person alpha:
yes, breakfast is included and parking is available.

person beta:
fantastic. thank you very much.

person alpha:
you're welcome. and we have 24 hour reception. please don't hesitate to call anytime if you have any further questions.

person beta:
i have been very busy this year, working late, often taking work home and taking no vacation. i feel exhausted.

person alpha:
you should ask for a holiday and relax yourself for a little bit. you worked so hard.

person beta:
you are right. for the past few weeks, i had no appetite and couldn't sleep well. what's worse my back started aching this monday. it is time for me to take a vacation.

person alpha:
what sort of shopping is nearby, mr. taylor?

person beta:
call me john. this is a great area of the city for shopping. there's a grocery store just around the corner.

person alpha:
what about things other than food?

person beta:
well, the riverside mall has 200 stores in it, including four major department stores.

person alpha:
are there small shops near here as well?

person beta:
yes, on 4th street, near the movie theater there are many specialty shops, including clothing boutiques.

person alpha:
well, that sounds just wonderful.

person beta:
yes, it's a really nice neighborhood.

person alpha:
now darling, i know that we've bought this house together, but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it. i think we should sell it.

person beta:
oh, no, nathan, i... i really think we've bought this flat at the right time, you know.market prices are going to go up, and i think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more.

person alpha:
but we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating. i think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished.

person beta:
but don't you like this place? i remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely.

person alpha:
well, only you liked it really, darling.

person beta:
oh, why didn't you say so then? but i still think we've made a good buy.

person alpha:
hi, bob, everything okay?

person beta:
more or less. there's just one thing bothering me.

person alpha:
oh? what's that?

person beta:
well, you know i have some students studying for their master's degree. one of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy.

person alpha:
what gift?

person beta:
it's an egyptian carpet. the student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude. seeing what gift was, i was really uncomfortable. i mean it's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor. i don't think i've done anything to deserve that gift, so i refused it.

person alpha:
you refused the gift? that's terrible.

person beta:
i know, but i really can't accept such an expensive gift. i explained to him why, but he seemed really upset about it. i think he might have taken it the wrong way.

person alpha:
perhaps. he probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade.

person beta:
that's what i am worried about. i do understand the respect attached with the gift and i am honored. but i really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor. i think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page.

person alpha:
i've been looking for a swimming pool, but i haven't found one yet.

person beta:
we have no pool, sir, but we do have swim stations in our gym.

person alpha:
swim stations? could you be a little more explicit?

person beta:
you know how you run on a treadmill but don't go anywhere? well, it's the same thing.

person alpha:
gee, that's a great idea. now, how much do i have to pay?

person beta:
the stations are absolutely free to guests, sir.

person alpha:
great! now, when can i go down there and use the stations?

person beta:
the swim stations are open daily from 7 a. m. to 10 p. m.

person alpha:
boy, oh boy! i can't wait to change into my swim trunks.

person beta:
be warned, sir. at certain hours the swim stations are very crowded.

person alpha:
hi. today, i am the interviewer for your visa application.

person beta:
ok. here is my application form and all the documents.

person alpha:
can you tell me why do you want a visa to america?

person beta:
because i want to have a view of the exotic landscapes to extend my views and understanding of the world.

person alpha:
ok. do you plan to go to america all by yourself or with your family?

person beta:
myself.

person alpha:
have you finished all you preparation?

person beta:
yes. everything is ready.

person alpha:
what a pity you are leaving so soon. i wish you could stay a few more days. sir, can you deliver a speech for us?

person beta:
dear friends. here, i wish to say a word of thanks for holding this send-off party for me. actually i didn't expect at all for this. i owe a lot to all of you here. it's been 5 days since i came to visit here. time really flies. i feel grateful for your welcome and help in the five days. i will miss you while i am leaving. let's keep in touch in any way. what's more, to the success of our face-to-face meeting, to the upcoming cooperation of our two companies, bottom up!

person alpha:
cheers! and we are honored to have such an honored guest today. mr. james, i hope we will meet somewhere in the near future.

person beta:
madam, we also welcome you to visit our company. i hope you can also bring your family there to have a look of our company. in this way, we will know each other better.

person alpha:
definitely! thank you!

person beta:
i have been thinking of buying a house and would like to speak with you.

person alpha:
i have time to speak with you. where would you like to purchase your house?

person beta:
i am most interested in pasadena or arcadia, but would be open to other suggestions.

person alpha:
how many bedrooms and bathrooms do you need?

person beta:
we have several generations of family living in our household and so need a very large home.

person alpha:
do you need to be located in a particular school district?

person beta:
it doesn't matter, as we do not have any children.

person alpha:
is a view important to you, or would you rather be located on a lakeshore lot?

person beta:
in a perfect world, we would like a home with a view of the lake.

person alpha:
thank you for all of the information. i will help you find the perfect house for you.

person beta:
waiter.

person alpha:
would you like anything else?

person beta:
no, thanks. please bring us the bill.

person alpha:
all right. and do you want to separate bills or just one single bill?

person beta:
separate bills, please.

person alpha:
here is your bill. it comes to 80 yuan. and yours is 60 yuan.

person beta:
here you are. thank you

person alpha:
if this coat doesn't fit, may i bring it back later?

person beta:
sorry, we don't take returns on sale items.

person alpha:
what are the attractions of that city?

person beta:
it's famous for beautiful countryside with clean air.

person alpha:
oh, that's what i am looking for. do you have a reduction for 6 persons?

person beta:
yes, sir. we offer a 10% discount for groups more than 5.

person alpha:
i would like to order a waistcoat.

person beta:
have you chosen the material?

person alpha:
yes, i want it to made of tweed.

person beta:
fine. and the charge is$ 100.

person alpha:
when will it be available?

person beta:
next wednesday.

person alpha:
hi, i'm george. i'll be your waiter this evening. are you ready to order or do you need a few more minutes?

person beta:
i'm ready now. i'd like the roast chicken and a side order of corn.

person alpha:
and would you like an appetizer before your meal? the soup of the day is our delicious tomato soup.

person beta:
i'll pass on the soup, but i'd like a garden salad.

person alpha:
can i get you anything to drink?

person beta:
yes, i'd like a glass of iced tea.

person alpha:
okay. i'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad.

person beta:
thank you.

person alpha:
what is your salary at present?

person beta:
my present pay is 100,000 yuan per year.

person alpha:
what are your salary expectations now?

person beta:
i like to be paid more than that. hopefully, 120,000 yuan per year.

person alpha:
that's a little more than we had planned.

person beta:
i think you'll find i'm worth that.

person alpha:
i can only offer you 110,000 yuan a year. raises will be given after a three-month probation according to your performance. is that satisfactory?

person beta:
yes, it is quite reasonable.

person alpha:
excuse me. i've been waiting for my main dish for quite a time.

person beta:
yes, sir.just a minute, please, i'll check with the kitchen.

person alpha:
thank you for waiting.it takes another ten to fifteen minutes, i'm afraid.

person beta:
we have an appointment in half an hour.

person alpha:
i see.

person beta:
do you have anything else i can have instead?

person alpha:
well, yes.how about beef stew? we can serve you at once.

person beta:
i'll take beef stew, then.

person alpha:
hi, sally! you are talking to the proud father of a new baby girl!

person beta:
congratulations, bob! that's great news, what's her name?

person alpha:
we've named her alice after my wife's grandmother.

person beta:
that's a pretty name. give your wife my best!

person alpha:
excuse me, can you tell me where is the taxi stand?

person beta:
you can find one at the end of the street.

person alpha:
are there any signs there?

person beta:
no.but there are quite many cars.

person alpha:
thank you.

person beta:
would dr.black be able to see me at 9:00 a. m. tomorrow?

person alpha:
i'm sorry, but she won't have any openings until 11:00, unless there's a cancellation.

person beta:
would 1: oo p. m. be convenient?

person alpha:
yes, she's free then.

person beta:
oh!!! i have a horrible toothache.

person alpha:
you should go to the dentist.

person beta:
i hate dentists.

person alpha:
well, suffer then. if you have a toothache, you have to go to the dentist.

person beta:
it always hurts. i hate going.

person alpha:
stop being such a baby. if it really hurts that much, just let them knock you out.

person beta:
o. k., o. k., i'll go.

person alpha:
good. you feel better after you do.

person beta:
sally, you look so corporate! what interview do you have today?

person alpha:
amalgamated trading company. it's swiss. don't you think working at a foreign company would be glamorous?

person beta:
yeah, i guess so. i've never actually heard of this one, but...

person alpha:
well, it's small, but it's a young, dynamic, rapidly-growing company with a progressive, humanistic philosophy.

person beta:
you didn't read their brochure or anything, did you?

person alpha:
four times. i'm totally prepared. oh, no! i forgot to take off my nail polish! and i have to be there in 15 minutes! that's it. i blew it.

person beta:
well, they are progressive and humanistic-maybe they don't care about nail polish... uh... even blue nail polish. just keep your confidence up and you'll do great.

person alpha:
but the competition is fierce this year... and it seems like i'm the only one left who hasn't found a job.

person beta:
not quite the only one. i really wanted that job at the magazine, but i still haven't heard from them.

person alpha:
i'm calling to tell you that the merchandise ordered last month has not arrived yet.

person beta:
i'm sorry, hold on a moment. i'll check it out. but we have already shipped it to you last month. would you like us to contact the express company to know what's going on?

person alpha:
please find out the reason as soon as possible. we are in bad need of it.

person beta:
ok, i am terribly sorry for the trouble you are getting into.we will contact you first thing, once we know the reason.

person alpha:
i really want to make something for dinner.

person beta:
what are you going to cook?

person alpha:
i haven't the slightest clue what i'm going to make.

person beta:
a teriyaki bowl sounds nice.

person alpha:
i don't know how to make that.

person beta:
all you need to make it is white rice and some teriyaki beef.

person alpha:
that sounds fairly simple, but how do i cook it?

person beta:
the first and simplest thing you have to do is make some white rice.

person alpha:
what's next?

person beta:
then you should shred your beef and pour some teriyaki marinade over it.

person alpha:
what's the next thing i need to do?

person beta:
then all you need to do is cook it and enjoy.

person alpha:
how do i submit an expense report?

person beta:
you need all your receipts for reimbursement.

person alpha:
you mean i have to attach the receipts with the expense report?

person beta:
yes, here is the form for an expense report. fill it out and give it to me. i'll get it signed for you.

person alpha:
good morning!

person beta:
can i speak to miss cooper please?

person alpha:
would you hold on a second, please? miss cooper's extension is engaged.

person beta:
engaged. oh, dear! could you tell her it's a long-distance call?

person alpha:
i'm sorry, sir. i can't interrupt her. i'm sure she won't be very long.

person beta:
how long do you think she'll be?

person alpha:
i really can't say how long she'll be.

person beta:
can i leave a message, please?

person alpha:
yes, certainly.

person beta:
can you tell her i'm waiting to speak to her?

person alpha:
yes, sir. i'll ring her on an inside line if you like.

person beta:
thank you very much.

person alpha:
excuse me, waiter, would you please bring us a nest? a friend of mine will join us.

person beta:
wait a moment. here you are.

person alpha:
by the way, we would like to order some dishes for my friend.

person beta:
sure.

person alpha:
can you help me out, chuck?

person beta:
sure. what's it, yvonne?

person alpha:
i want to put my desk over there, but it's too heavy for me to move.

person beta:
okay, you take one end and i'll take the other.

person alpha:
good morning. madam. what can i do for you today?

person beta:
hello. i hope you can help me; i'm a little worried about my new card.

person alpha:
what seems to be the problem?

person beta:
i received my new card this morning, but i'm unable to use it.

person alpha:
oh? you mean, the atm machine has eaten it?

person beta:
no, it's right here, see? the atm will not accept it!

person alpha:
you said you received your card this morning, am i right?

person beta:
yes. i was told it would be activated and ready to use right away. so, what's gone wrong?

person alpha:
did you receive your pin number yet, madam? you see, unless you have your new pin number, to match your new card, you cannot use it. we usually send that separately, around one day after the card, for security reasons.

person beta:
well, that explains it. i've been using my old pin number! thanks for explaining everything to me.

person alpha:
can you manage chopsticks?

person beta:
why not? see.

person alpha:
good mastery. how do you like our chinese food?

person beta:
oh, great! it's delicious. you see, i am already putting on weight. there is one thing i don't like however, msg.

person alpha:
what's wrong with msg? it helps to bring out the taste of the food.

person beta:
according to some studies it may cause cancer.

person alpha:
oh, don't let that worry you. if that were true, china wouldn't have such a large population.

person beta:
i just happen to have a question for you guys. why do the chinese cook the vegetables? you see what i mean is that most vitamin are destroyed when heated.

person alpha:
i don't know exactly. it's a tradition. maybe it's for sanitary reasons.

person beta:
hi, francis, how was your business trip?

person alpha:
it was a nightmare.

person beta:
what's up?

person alpha:
actually, the business trip itself was very successful. we arrived on time, we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year.

person beta:
sounds quite fruitful, why do you call it still a nightmare then?

person alpha:
well, the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then i lost my carry on bag when i was tackling with the officers in charge. i left the airport three hours later than i expected and then i was caught in a traffic jam. when i finally got home, i was totally exhausted. but i found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout.

person beta:
this is really a sad story. did they trace back your luggage?

person alpha:
i am still waiting for their call.

person beta:
take it easy, all sufferings have their reward.

person alpha:
do you have any seat preferences, sir?

person beta:
yes, could you put me in the no-smoking section?

person alpha:
yes. would you like a window seat?

person beta:
if one's available, please. but not over the wing.

person alpha:
morning. rent-a-car agency. may i help you?

person beta:
good morning. this is paul alexander calling from the isis advertising firm. we need a car to the airport for mr. phillips.

person alpha:
certainly, mr. alexander. when would mr. phillips like to leave?

person beta:
let me check... his flight's at 2:30 p. m., so he should leave no later than 12 noon.

person alpha:
i'm calling today about a bill that i never received.

person beta:
can you tell me which credit card it was for?

person alpha:
it was for my master card.

person beta:
you should've gotten that bill two weeks ago.

person alpha:
i haven't got it in the mail yet.

person beta:
the computer is showing that all bills have been mailed.

person alpha:
what am i supposed to do about my bill then?

person beta:
maybe you should call your post office.

person alpha:
but if it's their mistake, can i get an extension on my bill payment?

person beta:
yes, but you will need to send us proof of their mistake.

person alpha:
okay, thank you very much for your help.

person beta:
not a problem. enjoy the rest of your day.

person alpha:
jenny, don't you think it's really charming?

person beta:
yes. it's a feast of eyes to walking in the museum.

person alpha:
let's take our time and enjoy the art and sprite of the famous museum.

person beta:
what a shame that we can't take pictures.

person alpha:
ok, allen. it's your turn. are you ready?

person beta:
i really would rather just listen. isn't there anyone else who wants to sing?

person alpha:
come on! in the two hours we've been here you haven't sung even one song!

person beta:
i know, but... hey, stanley's here! i've been wanting to hear him sing all night.

person alpha:
well, you asked for it. why don't you put on an elvis song for him. he loves" the king."

person beta:
i'll put the song at the front of the list.

person alpha:
here is the document you asked for this morning.

person beta:
oh, you are so efficient. i thought you might give it to me tomorrow. thanks.

person alpha:
you're welcome. you know, these days i have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination. the more i think about it, the more i hate myself for being so disorganized. i decided to change the situation as soon as possible. otherwise i will be more regretful later.

person beta:
this is encouraging news, good for you! what is your solution, then?

person alpha:
the most useful method is to make plans and set priorities. it helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place.

person beta:
sounds not bad! better performance isn't just about doing a lot more. it is about focusing on the right things to do.

person alpha:
how are you doing, jim?

person beta:
fine, just fine.how about you?

person alpha:
not too bad.

person beta:
i think your presentation impressed the client, daniel. you did a good job.

person alpha:
thank you, mr. cooper. i hope we get the contract.

person beta:
what's for lunch?

person alpha:
pork chops.

person beta:
what happened to you?

person alpha:
i think i caught a cold.

person beta:
do you have any symptoms?

person alpha:
runny nose and coughing.

person beta:
do you have a fever?

person alpha:
i have just taken the temperature, i don't think so.

person beta:
it's not serious.

person alpha:
are you sure?

person beta:
yes.

person alpha:
what should i do?

person beta:
you should drink more hot water, and do some exercise.

person alpha:
what kind of place shall we rent?

person beta:
it should be close to the university. neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is, the later we can get up.

person alpha:
absolutely. that's the most important thing to take into consideration. i'm not too worried about the size of the flat.

person beta:
neither am i. so a small place is ok, but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive. do you mind if it's in a noisy area.

person alpha:
i don't mind. i'm not a light sleeper, but quieter is better for when we have to study at home.

person beta:
good point. ok, let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us.

person alpha:
yes, if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days. i think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early.

person beta:
how much do you think the rent will be?

person alpha:
i asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month.

person beta:
i don't think we can meet the delivery date you suggest. it's too soon.

person alpha:
well, is it possible for you to effect shipment by the middle of june?

person beta:
the earliest we can do is by the end of june.

person alpha:
did you have any working experience during college?

person beta:
yes, i did some part-time jobs such as english tutor, salesman, and model.

person alpha:
what did you learn from your part-time jobs?

person beta:
i learned to be patient, professional and gained a ll of experience of direct sales.

person alpha:
smells good! what's for breakfast?

person beta:
well, since we are getting up so late, i decided to make a big breakfast!

person alpha:
nice! brunch!

person beta:
kind of, so i made scrambled and soft boiled eggs, some french toast and buttermilk pancakes!

person alpha:
wow! you really went all out! did you make any coffee?

person beta:
yeah, just the way you like it! i also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light.

person alpha:
looks good! i'll squeeze us some fresh orange juice.

person beta:
get the jam and butter while you are in there! oh! and don't forget the syrup!

person alpha:
can you tell me if there is a flight to new york?

person beta:
yes. flight db117 departs at 5:38 pm and arrives in new york at 6:00 am with a layover in chicago. it also makes a refueling stop at colombia.

person alpha:
so many stops! don't you have any direct flights?

person beta:
sorry sir, it is the only flight wa have right now.

person alpha:
hello.hot water overflowed from the bathtub.will you help me?

person beta:
would you turn off the tap?

person alpha:
i did it.

person beta:
then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door?

person alpha:
ok. i will.

person beta:
i'll have our housekeeper come right away.

person alpha:
i'm sorry i was too tired to fall asleep.

person beta:
when you woke up, the water was coming out of the tub.

person alpha:
right.can i compensate for the damage with the travel accident insurance?

person beta:
would you like some more coffee?

person alpha:
no thanks. i'm full. we need to find our waitress and get our bill.

person beta:
the waitress is bringing the bill right now.

person alpha:
this waitress has really been on top of things, hasn't she?

person beta:
yes, this waitress did a great job.

person alpha:
ok, let's see what the damage is. the total for our meal is$ 36.00.

person beta:
what do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip?

person alpha:
fifteen percent is a normal tip, but she really did a great job. what do you think about 20% this time?

person beta:
yes, 20% would be perfect.

person alpha:
her tip will end up being$ 7.20 plus the bill of$ 36.00. the total will be$ 43.20.

person beta:
yes, that was one fantastic meal!

person alpha:
i agree. maybe we can come back again next week.

person beta:
it's time for me to go now.

person alpha:
would you like me to go with you?

person beta:
i'd rather you stayed in the office and did these things.

person alpha:
do you want to type that letter?

person beta:
i'd rather you typed it.

person alpha:
do you want to tell her?

person beta:
i'd rather you told her.

person alpha:
freeze! police! put your hands over your head.

person beta:
what crime did i commit?

person alpha:
you are suspected of hiding illegal drugs, so we are taking you into custody. we've found some heroin in your house. you have the following rights while you are being interviewed. you have the right to remain silent. you don't have to make any statement against your will. you have the right to defense counsel. you have the right to request an investigation of evidence favorable to your case. do you understand your rights?

person beta:
i am innocent.

person alpha:
would you like to come by and play bridge?

person beta:
well, let's see. why don't we go dancing for a change? we haven't done that for a long time.

person alpha:
well, to tell the truth, i don't really feel like it tonight. i had a pretty hard day and i'm sort of tired.

person beta:
hmm. well, in that case, we could go to the movies.

person alpha:
oh, we always go to the movies. can't we do something different?

person beta:
well, do you have any suggestions?

person alpha:
let's see. how do you feel about playing bridge?

person beta:
it's ok with me, but we don't have any beer and things.

person alpha:
well, shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over, and i'll go to the store and buy some stuff.

person beta:
ok.

person alpha:
hello, janet. it's me... oh, fine. just fine. say, janet, i was wondering if you and tom were doing anything tonight... no? well. would you like to come by our place and play a few hands of bridge?

person beta:
tom, it's time for you to go to bed.

person alpha:
good night, mum.

person beta:
good night.

person alpha:
operator. may i help you?

person beta:
yes. how do i get an outside line, please?

person alpha:
just dial 0, wait for the dial tone, and then dial the phone number you want to call. or we can place a call for you, if you want.

person beta:
no, thanks a lot. i'll try it myself.

person alpha:
what's our target audience for this campaign?

person beta:
this go-around we're focusing on new moms, families with median income and one or more children under the age of two.

person alpha:
do you think that's much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for?

person beta:
well, there are some similarities that come up. because both groups are made up of mothers... so as before, we can play up on maternal instincts, hygiene, safety, along those lines. but that being said, there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here.

person alpha:
right, that makes sense. what's the average age?

person beta:
demographics say an average age of 28.7, educational background of university or post-grad, annual household income of 40-50 k a year.

person alpha:
john, i'd like to see you in my office for a minute.

person beta:
yes, sir, i'll be there in just a moment.

person alpha:
john, i have been watching you. i've been paying attention to you over the last quarter and i'm impressed. you've done a tremendous job in tackling some difficult accounts. i just want to let you to know, after this month's performance reviews, i'm recommending you for promotion.

person beta:
gosh sir, thank you, sir! i had no idea there were any positions opening up in our department.

person alpha:
well, it's not going to be in our department. i've recommended you for an interdepartmental transfer. there's supervisory spot opening up in financial. i'm turning your name in for it.

person beta:
management? wow, i had no idea i could move so quickly from entry level to managerial staff.

person alpha:
you've earned it.

person beta:
how can i help you today?

person alpha:
i am returning something that i bought yesterday.

person beta:
what would you like to return?

person alpha:
i'm returning a cellphone.

person beta:
was there something wrong with it?

person alpha:
it's defective.

person beta:
what isn't working on it?

person alpha:
it keeps turning off on it's own.

person beta:
alright, do you have the receipt?

person alpha:
i have it right here.

person beta:
i'm going to take care of this and refund your money.

person alpha:
thanks for your help.

person beta:
i miss grandma. i dreamed about her yesterday.

person alpha:
dear, let's drop the subject.

person beta:
good morning, sir. can i help you?

person alpha:
good morning. i'd like to cash this check.

person beta:
yes, sir. can you show you identity?

person alpha:
what about the driving license?

person beta:
don't you have any other identification?

person alpha:
i am sorry. i only have my driving license with me.

person beta:
ok. would you please sign your name on the back of the check?

person alpha:
thank you. here you are.

person beta:
how do you want your money?

person alpha:
would you give me some in twenties and tens?

person beta:
all right. please wait for a moment.

person alpha:
could you fill in this form, please?

person beta:
all right.

person alpha:
have you got any identification?

person beta:
yes, here's my id card.

person alpha:
oh, my god! i've been cheated!

person beta:
what? what did you buy?

person alpha:
it's a brick! i can't believe how stupid i was. damn it!

person beta:
what is it? why did you buy a brick?

person alpha:
there was a guy on the sidewalk.he had three new boxes, panasonic video camera boxes.he said he had to get rid of them quick.

person beta:
and?

person alpha:
so he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars. a four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks.

person beta:
and it's a brick?

person alpha:
yes.

person beta:
i can't believe how stupid you are. why didn't you open the box?

person alpha:
i wanted to. but he said, no, the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.if it's opened, other people won't believe it's new.

person beta:
so he had the boxes wrapped in plastic.

person alpha:
yes, it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.look, it even had a bar-code price sticker on it! it looked brand new.

person beta:
but why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars?

person alpha:
he said he had to get rid of them. they were stolen.

person beta:
aha! now i understand.you were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.so, what i think is, you deserve to get cheated!

person alpha:
c'mon, don't blame me! i thought it was a new camera. we could use it.we were even thinking about buying a camera. i don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box.

person beta:
that's no problem.he just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap. that's easy.and probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.maybe his friend works in an electronics store. they sell video cameras there.probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.so they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.twenty dollars a brick. that's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks.

person alpha:
you're right, sarah. i was a fool. i can't believe it. how could i fall for such a trick?

person beta:
hello, arthur. what seems to be the problem?

person alpha:
hey doc. well, i think i might need glasses. i'm getting headaches, and i really struggle to see things that are far away. but i have always had 20/20 vision.

person beta:
sounds like you may be far-sighted. ok, then, cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you.

person alpha:
mmm... x, e, r, 3, a question mark, and i can't quite make out the other symbol but i think it's the peace sign.

person beta:
wow, arthur! you're as blind as a bat!

person alpha:
yeah, i know, my vision is really blurry at times.

person beta:
ok then, head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while i fill out your prescription.

person alpha:
thanks doc!

person beta:
arthur, that's the bathroom.

person alpha:
would you like some more coffee?

person beta:
no thanks. i'm full. we need to find our waitress and get our bill.

person alpha:
good luck finding the waitress!

person beta:
the service this evening has kind of sucked. is that our server over there?

person alpha:
i'll go get the check, since our server doesn't seem to be headed this way.

person beta:
good. i'll just stay here until you get back.

person alpha:
so the total is$ 36.00 for our dinner.

person beta:
how much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves?

person alpha:
i wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service.

person beta:
i kind of feel the same way, but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight.

person alpha:
i think that we should leave 10%.

person beta:
$ 3.60 will be the right amount for the tip.

person alpha:
i want to fly to congo on monday, the 17th.

person beta:
let me see what's available.

person alpha:
by the way, i'd prefer a night flight.

person beta:
africa airline 551 leaves at 9:00 pm.

person alpha:
that's fine. i want to pay in cash. here is the money.

person beta:
how much was your watch?

person alpha:
take a guess.

person beta:
a guy in my office got the flu the other day. today i seem to have come down with it, too.

person alpha:
very likely. you have a slight fever. do you have a headache, too?

person beta:
yes. i wonder if you could do something to help me recover soon, because i'll be on a business trip in two days.

person alpha:
well, you have to let your flu run its course. you must stop working and stay in bed to get plenty of rest. usually it will take 4 to 6 days to make a full recovery.

person beta:
but i'm going on a business trip in two days!

person alpha:
maybe you'll have to cancel it or postpone it. if you go out while you are sick, it won't help you recover. you may even pass your disease on to others.

person beta:
would you care for a drink?

person alpha:
no, thanks. i'm fine.

person beta:
let's go practice your driving.

person alpha:
if that's what you want to do, then we can.

person beta:
did you buckle your seatbelt?

person alpha:
i'm buckled up. what's next?

person beta:
you need to start the car now.

person alpha:
what do you want me to do?

person beta:
go left.

person alpha:
how far should i go?

person beta:
i'll let you know when i want you to stop.

person alpha:
tell me before you want me to stop.

person beta:
all right, try parking here.

person alpha:
thanks. let's go driving again tomorrow.

person beta:
how may i help you?

person alpha:
i'm making a deposit today.

person beta:
cash or check?

person alpha:
i would like to deposit a check.

person beta:
you need to sign the back.

person alpha:
okay. here you go.

person beta:
would you like cash back?

person alpha:
yes, i would.

person beta:
how much?

person alpha:
let me get$ 150 back.

person beta:
here you go.

person alpha:
thank you. have a good one.

person beta:
i'd like to extend my visa for another two years.

person alpha:
are you on a tourist visa or a student visa?

person beta:
student visa.

person alpha:
what is the reason for extension?

person beta:
i'll go into a practical training as soon as i receive my master's degree from the university of pennsylvania early next month.

person alpha:
we'll need a letter from your university and a financial statement from you.

person beta:
do you like the apartment?

person alpha:
i absolutely love the apartment.

person beta:
everything is okay?

person alpha:
i do have one problem with the apartment.

person beta:
what's the problem?

person alpha:
i don't like all those stains in the carpet.

person beta:
we will have the carpet cleaned before you move into the apartment.

person alpha:
i did not know that.

person beta:
i assure you that we will, and if there are any more problems, feel free to tell me.

person alpha:
that was the only thing that i saw wrong with the apartment.

person beta:
i'm glad to know that you think the apartment is so nice.

person alpha:
it's absolutely incredible. i'll take it.

person beta:
come in, arnold. have a seat.

person alpha:
good morning.

person beta:
would you like something to drink?

person alpha:
no, thank you. i just had two cups of coffee at my desk.

person beta:
so, you're a serious coffee drinker.

person alpha:
yes, it keeps me going. sometimes i think i'm addicted.

person beta:
well, coffee isn't such a bad thing.everyone has to have something.for me, it's cigars. are you a cigar smoker?

person alpha:
no, i've tried them. but i'm not really a smoker.

person beta:
well, what would you like to talk to me about?

person alpha:
i wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal.

person beta:
i'm glad when people have new ideas around here. tell me about it.

person alpha:
it is about the staff meetings.you know how we have a staff meeting every tuesday.

person beta:
yes.

person alpha:
well, i have been thinking about it.and i believe we could do things more efficiently here.

person beta:
what do you suggest?

person alpha:
the way it is now, the staff from all four branches get together once a week.we meet for one hour. but i think a lot of time is wasted in transportation.

person beta:
you mean because people have to go across town to get here.

person alpha:
yes. some people spend half of the morning on the road.

person beta:
that's true. but our staff meetings are very important, arnold. i don't know how we can function without them.

person alpha:
i think they are important too.that's why i want people to have a better attitude about them.

person beta:
i know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful. i'm aware of that.

person alpha:
here's what i propose. i think we should meet once every two weeks, but meet for ninety minutes or more.

person beta:
well.

person alpha:
i also think the meetings should be more focused.and i would be willing to take responsibility for that.

person beta:
you mean you want to run the meetings?

person alpha:
no, not really run them. but i could help organize them. i could discuss meeting topics with you, and then prepare a schedule for each meeting. i could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.this way the meetings would become more focused, and people would prepare better.

person beta:
hmm. but we would meet every two weeks.

person alpha:
i really think it would work.the meetings could be longer, and better organized.

person beta:
i am not against the idea, arnold.it may really be more efficient, as you say. i'll tell you what we can do.why don't we try your proposal for a month, and see how it works.

person alpha:

i'll put the shopping basket back.

person alpha:
did you lock the doors?

person beta:
all except the back door. i left that open for tim. he took the dog for a walk.

person alpha:
well, i'm going on to bed. i'm beat.

person beta:
okay. i'm going to stay up a while. i've got to go over the household budget. we're a little overspent this month.

person alpha:
please tell tim to close the door to the basement. i don't want the dog down there tonight.

person beta:
okay. good night. see you at breakfast.

person alpha:
well, i'm glad you're finally back. i was wondering what happened.

person beta:
i feel kind of stupid.

person alpha:
why?

person beta:
we got lost coming back. i guess i don't really know this town yet.

person alpha:
you got lost. you're kidding!

person beta:
no. we took a wrong turn somewhere.and joseph doesn't know the town at all. so i started giving him directions.but i didn't really know where we were. so we got seriously lost.

person alpha:
you could have called.

person beta:
i know i could have. but finally we asked someone where we were.

person alpha:
you've been gone for two hours. how could you get lost for so long?

person beta:
guess where we ended up.

person alpha:
i don't know. where?

person beta:
when we finally decided to ask someone, they told us we were in grangerfield.

person alpha:
grangerfield! you were in grangerfield? that's a completely different town! how could you drive to a completely different town?

person beta:
i don't know.the person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here.

person alpha:
grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here.

person beta:
i know it is. i don't know how it happened.

person alpha:
hmm, maybe i do.

person beta:
what?

person alpha:
maybe i have an idea how it happened.

person beta:
how?

person alpha:
you were too busy looking at joseph, and you weren't paying attention to the road.

person beta:
oh, that's what you think, huh?

person alpha:
won't you have some of this?

person beta:
yes, thanks.

person alpha:
it's my grandmother's favorite recipe for barbecue.

person beta:
it's very good. how do you make it?

person alpha:
i use a special dressing and homemade catsup.

person beta:
this salad looks so nice-just right for a hot day.

person alpha:
i'm glad you like it.

person beta:
you americans usually have nutritious food.

person alpha:
oh, but chinese food is so delicious. i wish i knew how to cook chinese food. do you follow recipes?

person beta:
we use different spices but few people use recipes. they learn to cook by experience.

person alpha:
i always use a recipe but my grandmother never did. she was a great cook. she would make clam chowder and cornbread every sunday night.

person beta:
i like these shoes.

person alpha:
do you realize that all these shoes are half off?

person beta:
really?

person alpha:
yes, but the offer only lasts this week.

person beta:
do you have experience in advertising?

person alpha:
yes, i used to have a part-time job in advertising company.

person beta:
what were you mean duties there?

person alpha:
i mostly did advertising planning.

person beta:
what qualities do you think an advertising planner should have?

person alpha:
i think an advertising planner should have active thoughts, creative talent, and be sensitive to the changes in the market.

person beta:
what was the most important thing you have learned at work?

person alpha:
the most important thing i learned was that i must continuously improve my abilities. advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact in success. if i want to make in marking in advertising history, i can't stop studying and creating.

person beta:
dad, may i have a room of my own?

person alpha:
oh, honey, i'm so sorry, we don't have enough space for you to have your own room.

person beta:
dad, but i don't want to share a room with peter. he snores every night.

person alpha:
honey, you can ask him to be quite. otherwise you may punish him and tell him to stand out of the room, right?

person beta:
alright. maybe it's the only way to do it.

person alpha:
come in and sit down, jack. now, what's the trouble?

person beta:
i've got a terrible pain in my stomach, doctor.

person alpha:
i see. when did it start?

person beta:
it started yesterday. i didn't eat any supper.

person alpha:
have you got a temperature?

person beta:
i think so. i feel very hot.

person alpha:
let's see. yes. you've got quite a high temperature.

person beta:
i've got an awful headache, too, and my throat hurts.

person alpha:
hm... i think you've got the flu.

person beta:
is it serious?

person alpha:
no, not at all, but you must stay in bed for three days and take this medicine.

person beta:
how often must i take it?

person alpha:
three times a day after meals.

person beta:
thank you, doctor.goodbye.

person alpha:
our usual supplier has let us down and i've been looking through your parts catalogue. i need fifty gt670s. how soon can you deliver?

person beta:
just a moment and i'll check. we're expecting a delivery on friday. we've only got ten in stock at the moment. i can deliver those by first thing tomorrow morning. there'll be an extra charge for special delivery. i'll have to send them by courier.

person alpha:
why don't you sit down and relax, darling?

person beta:
i don't want to.

person alpha:
well, come and talk to me then.

person beta:
certainly not.

person alpha:
may i turn on the radio then?

person beta:
turn on the radio? what for?

person alpha:
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music.

person beta:
listen to some music? and who'll cook dinner? will you?

person alpha:
ok, i will. but let's go to a disco after dinner.

person beta:
to a disco? oh, no. you know i hate pop.

person alpha:
good afternoon, ma'am. may i help you?

person beta:

you're welcome.

person beta:

person beta:
how long does it take?

person alpha:
6 hours. if you are in a hurry we can develop it in 3 hours.

person beta:
there is no need. i will come back tomorrow.

person alpha:
good afternoon miss, would you be interested in buying more life insurance? you know, you can never get enough.

person beta:
i think my husband has some.

person alpha:
are you sure he's purchased enough insurance for both of you? if something terrible happened with your husband, and he doesn't have sufficient insurance, my company does have a policy that could cover you and your husband if something happened to either of you.

person beta:
that's true. if something happened to my husband, i might lose everything. both of us have to work to keep our home, car, and our children's education. i can't afford that by myself.

person alpha:
could we sit and look at the policy i mentioned and see if that's something suitable for you and your husband?

person beta:
certainly.

person alpha:
the buildings are really magnificent.

person beta:
yes, millions of travelers come here every year for the view of the buildings.

person alpha:
the journey is worth while. where are we going after this?

person beta:
we will visit the statue of liberty as scheduled.

person alpha:
excuse me.

person beta:
yes?

person alpha:
do you have any information about the city sights?

person beta:
sure. there's a lot here in this pamphlet.

person alpha:
thank you. and what's the best way to get downtown?

person beta:
take the subway. it's$ 1.50 per ride. you can buy a petrol card at the station.

person alpha:
you've been very helpful.

person beta:
my pleasure.

person alpha:
i want to open a saving account, sir.what's the proper procedure?

person beta:
first, you fill out the application form and then we'll issue you a passbook.

person alpha:
is there any minimum for the first deposit?

person beta:
no, even a dollar is all right.here's your passbook, sir; just sign your name on it.

person alpha:
what is the annual interest rate?

person beta:
it varies from time to time.at present it is 6%.

person alpha:
by the way, can i open a checking account too?

person beta:
by all means.but you have to deposit enough money before you can write out your checks.

person alpha:
you look depressed. what's on your mind?

person beta:
well, i had a blood test last week. the doctor said that i have high blood pressure and my blood is thick and sticky. i'm very worried.

person alpha:
take it easy. when we last talked, you promised there would be more exercises in your life. but now you are putting on some weight.

person beta:
i have to admit it's easier said than done.

person alpha:
well, i think it's time for you to change your eating habits and develop a healthy lifestyle. regular exercise will improve your health.

person beta:
but you know i'm just not into exercises. and i wouldn't have time for exercises, either.

person alpha:
you can do some jogging. it's easy and it doesn't take much time.

person beta:
actually, my doctor said the same thing.

person alpha:
excuse me, sir, but you have to put your bags here before entering the market.

person beta:
oh. i am sorry. i was busy looking for some whisky.can you tell me the exactly place where i can find any?

person alpha:
yes, it's on the third floor.

person beta:
here's my passport. i'm a visiting scholar.

person alpha:
do you have anything to declare?

person beta:
no, these are all my personal effects.

person alpha:
what's in the bag? would you mind opening the bag?

person beta:
not at all. i don't know what's dutiable. do i have to pay duty on things for my own use?

person alpha:
no. you don't have to pay duty on personal belongings.

person beta:
thank you.

person alpha:
do you work well under pressure?

person beta:
working under pressure is exciting and challenging. i don't mind working under pressure. i work well under that circumstance. people can, i can.

person alpha:
do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration?

person beta:
no, nothing in particular.

person alpha:
how soon can you begin working for us?

person beta:
i need about two to three weeks for necessary formalities. i will quit then transfer to your company.

person alpha:
what do you want?

person beta:
i think i have a piece of apple pie.

person alpha:
do you want something to drink?

person beta:
coffee would be fine.

person alpha:
ok. sit down and i'll get it.

person beta:
our new production control program's going live on monday. the old and the new programs will operate in tandem for four to six weeks. that should give us time to iron out any little problems.

person alpha:
hope it all goes well. we're very busy at the moment and certainly don't want any problems at this time of year.

person beta:
yes, i realise that. we've spent a long time planning and preparing for the change-over. i'm confident we won't have any major problems.

person beta:

person alpha:
come in, please.

person beta:
good morning, sir!

person alpha:
good morning, please make yourself comfortable.

person beta:
thank you, sir.

person alpha:

person beta:
my name is du tao, number 3.

person alpha:

person beta:
du tao. d-u for du and t-a- 0 for tao.

person alpha:
yes, mr. du, when were you born?

person beta:
i was born on january 1st, 1988. i'm 20 years old now.

person alpha:
where do you live?

person beta:
i'm living at room 222, building 18, n. p. u.

person alpha:
can you leave me your phone number?

person beta:
gladly, 8962105 2.

person alpha:
good morning. may i help you?

person beta:
yes. i'm looking for an apartment, i'd like two bedrooms.

person alpha:
all right. have a seat, please. let me ask you a few questions. first of all, may i have your name, please?

person beta:
my name's donald eakins.

person alpha:
how do you spell your last name, mr.eakins.

person beta:
it's e-a-k-i-n-s.

person alpha:
e-a-k-i-n-s.first name, donald. and what's your present address, mr.eakins?

person beta:
it's 1446 pine street.

person alpha:
1446 pine. that's in san francisco, isn't it?

person beta:
yes, it is.

person alpha:
did you check before you left the shop?

person beta:
yes, i did. but when i got home, my son put it on and we found the hole.

person alpha:
really? let me have a look at it. mm. ok. let me change it for another one.

person beta:
thank you very much.

person alpha:
i hate to do this, but i've got to cancel a reservation i made earlier this week.

person beta:
all i need is your name, phone, and reservation date.

person alpha:
my name is rudy randolph. i'm at 818-555-1234. the reservation was for april 9.

person beta:
randolph, rudy. let me hit one button, sir, and now your reservation is cancelled.

person alpha:
okay, thank you. i'll make another reservation as soon as i can.

person beta:
it's been my pleasure to help you.

person alpha:
did you go and buy your bus pass?

person beta:
no, i didn't.

person alpha:
when are you going to go get it?

person beta:
i'm not sure where they sell bus passes at.

person alpha:
why didn't you just ask me?

person beta:
where should i go?

person alpha:
you can get one from student services.

person beta:
i had no clue that i could get it there.

person alpha:
i already knew that.

person beta:
thanks for letting me know.

person alpha:
you're welcome.

person beta:
i'm going to go and get it right now.

person alpha:
tomorrow is my first day at work, what do you think i should be wearing?

person beta:
well, if you want to look professional, serious and more conservative, a blue dress, white shirt and not-too-high shoes would be the best choice. but sometimes, very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues. it depends on the company's dress code.

person alpha:
indeed, i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview. only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony. it seems that their dress code is not that formal. probably, i should put on car key and simple shirt.

person beta:
whatever you choose, make sure they are neat and clean.

person alpha:
excuse me. will you please keep an eye on my suitcase? i just want to make a phone call.

person beta:
certainly, but will it take long?

person alpha:
no, i'll be right back.

person beta:
ok. i'll look after it then.

person alpha:
mike's mechanics. can i help you?

person beta:
yes, how do i get to your shop from chilin?

person alpha:
go straight up zhongshan road and you will see our sign on your right, after you pass the museum.

person beta:
thank you very much.

person alpha:
don't take too much off. i'm trying to grow my hair longer.

person beta:
how about two inches?

person alpha:
that sounds perfect. do you think i can get some highlights today, too? i've always wanted red.

person beta:
i think that will over-process your hair, you should wait at least two weeks.

person alpha:
all right. i'll just have the cut and perm today.

person beta:
great. my assistant will wash your hair, and then i'll be back to help you.

person alpha:
ok.

person beta:
oh, damn. there's another traffic jam on the highway.

person alpha:
how can there be a traffic jam on a 16- lane highway every day?

person beta:
there are just too many people, and too many cars.

person alpha:
i wonder if there was an accident.

person beta:
no, they just said it too many people were trying to get off at the capitol exits.

person alpha:
well, let's put on some music. we're going to be stuck in this for a while.

person beta:
all right, what do you want to listen to?

person alpha:
how about some beatles?

person beta:
yeah, all right.

person alpha:
excuse me. mr. emory?

person beta:
yes, ms. rodriguez? how can i help you?

person alpha:
i wanted to see if i could arrange a meeting with you to discuss recruitment.

person beta:
absolutely. i've been wanting to meet with you about that. let me just get my book.

person alpha:

person beta:

person alpha:

person beta:

person alpha:
sorry, you have the wrong number. there's no brian here.

person beta:

person alpha:

person beta:
oh, i'm so sorry.

person alpha:
that's ok.

person beta:
put all baggage on the conveyor belt. walk through the detector age one at a time, please.

person alpha:
excuse me, ma'ma. could you walk back through the doorway again, please?

person beta:
what for?

person alpha:
airport security. could you empty your pockets over here, please?

person beta:
really? i'm in a hurry. all right.

person alpha:
ah, a set of keys.

person beta:
i'm embarrassed! i forgot completely about them. i'm terribly sorry.

person alpha:
that's all right. enjoy your flight.

person beta:
thank you.

person alpha:
what's the matter with you, paul?

person beta:
i'm not feeling well. i think i'm having a cold.

person alpha:
looks like it.you need to drink a lot of water and take a good rest.

person beta:
yeah, i will.

person alpha:

person beta:
oh, sorry. cross my fingers.

person alpha:

person beta:
do you have a washer down there?

person alpha:
yes. we have a dryer, too.

person beta:
that's so convenient. where are the dirty clothes?

person alpha:
they are in the basement already.

person beta:
but i didn't see you carry them down.

person alpha:
don't you know that we have a laundry chute in the house?

person beta:
hi, john.

person alpha:
oh, hi, mary, come on in. any problem?

person beta:
oh, no problem.

person alpha:
great. i forgot to ask you, though. how long did you want the place?

person beta:
six months.

person alpha:
oh, well, that might be a problem. i usually only sign one year leases.

person beta:
well, one year would be fine, too. i'm not planning on leaving the area anytime soon.

person alpha:
well, if it's not a problem. then here you go.

person beta:
just let me look at it quickly.

person alpha:
of course.

person beta:
looks like a standard lease.

person alpha:
yeah, and don't worry about the security deposit. if everything's all right when you move out, you'll get it back.

person beta:
o. k. great. just sign and date it here?

person alpha:
yes. thanks. you can move your stuff in tomorrow.

person beta:
wonderful.

person alpha:
excuse me, could you tell me the bookshop's address?

person beta:
yes, the bookshop is just around the corner.turn left and you'll see the bookshop.

person alpha:
thank you very much.by the way, is the hospital beside the bookshop.

person beta:
right, if you see the bookshop, you can see the hospital.

person alpha:
thank you for your help.

person beta:
not at all.

person alpha:
hello! is this mr. chang?

person beta:
yes. who is speaking?

person alpha:
this is kelly speaking. i am calling from london. how are you, mr. chang?

person beta:
oh, kelly, i couldn't recognize your voice. well, i'm fine.

person alpha:
mr. chang, i just want to tell you that we are leaving london for beijing by flight cp 645 on saturday morning. could you meet us at the airport, please?

person beta:
excuse me, i couldn't quite hear you. this line is crossed. can you speak louder, please?

person alpha:
i will say it again... do you hear me now?

person beta:

person alpha:
thank you very much. goodbye.

person beta:
goodbye.

person alpha:
hello, mr. hammer. jack ross here. i'm calling to confirm our appointment on monday at ten o'clock in your office.

person beta:
yes. everything's all set.

person alpha:
i'd like to bring mr. huang and ms. sun with me.

person beta:
we're supposed to be meeting alone.

person alpha:
i know, but i think they may add something valuable to the discussion.

person beta:
fine. but no one else, ok?

person alpha:
yes, mr. hammer.

person beta:
how beautiful the flower is!

person alpha:
really, it's so beautiful.

person beta:
you like it. well, i'll gather in for you.

person alpha:
you mustn't pick it in this place.

person beta:
where it is?

person alpha:
it's a private garden.

person beta:
you look fresh recently. and.. what's your weight now?

person alpha:
110 pounds.

person beta:
really? congratulations! that's really something beyond my imagination. how did you make it? did you keep on a diet?

person alpha:
no, you know i can't bear eating less.

person beta:
then do the slim pills take effect on you?

person alpha:
i've quit it already. i go to aerobics class everyday instead.

person beta:
how's it going on?

person alpha:
you see. i've lost my weight in spite of my good appetite.

person beta:
i'd better exercise my body too. my limbs are rusty now.

person alpha:
i don't think so. you look full of energy every day. time has stood still with you.

person beta:
thank you.

person alpha:
ahhs! i'm beat!

person beta:
what happened to you? you look like you got hit by a tornado!

person alpha:
i just got back from fighting the crowds.

person beta:
you mean at the mall? was there a sale?

person alpha:
yeah. for five minutes, everything was half off. it was total chaos...

person beta:
cool!

person alpha:
grabbing, pushing and shoving...

person beta:
thank god you are open! i have an emergency!

person alpha:
hello, mr. henderson what can i do for you?

person beta:
i need this dress and this suit dry cleaned asap!

person alpha:
ok, i can have it ready by the end of the week.

person beta:
no, you don't understand, i need this tomorrow morning! i accidentally spilled beer all over my wife's dress and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow! she's gonna kill me!

person alpha:
ok, i can have it ready tomorrow afternoon, but this suit is also very stained. i can't guarantee we can remove it completely.

person beta:
fine! can you also iron and starch this shirt?

person alpha:
certainly.

person beta:
great! this is our secret! if you see my wife, say nothing to her about this!

person alpha:
how often does the bus run?

person beta:
every five minutes.

person alpha:
oh, here comes a bus!

person beta:
it comes on the dot.

person alpha:
my warmest congratulations on your promotion!

person beta:
thanks. it's nothing special actually.

person alpha:
don't say that. it owes to your efforts and team spirit.

person beta:
oh, it was nothing. anyone could have done it. i still have a lot to learn yet.

person alpha:
you are very modest. best luck in your new position.

person beta:
thank you. i won't let this promotion change me.

person alpha:
yes, emergency. there is a huge fire here.

person beta:
calm down, sir. what's your name and where are you now?

person alpha:
my name is jerry and we are on the intersection of west road and east road.

person beta:
sir, leave the house if the fire draws any closer to your house. our men will be over in 5 minutes.

person alpha:
do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work?

person beta:
of course! it is the no. 1 stressor in my life. you know job stress has become a very common problem these days. so we must learn to cope with it.

person alpha:
totally agree. what is your solution?

person beta:
well, there are two causes of job stress. one is employee characteristic and the other is company condition. so if we want to manage job stress, both we and the companies should do something. for me, i am trying to balance work and leisure time. you know, all work and no play make jack a dull boy.

person alpha:
you seem to have a very relaxed outlook.

person beta:
it is necessary. positive attitude helps to prevent stress.

person alpha:
but i don't think we can change our working condition. anyway, we are not the bosses.

person beta:
i heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them, like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities. our boss is a smart person. he will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team.

person alpha:
excuse me, is this the parcel counter?

person beta:
yes, what can i do for you?

person alpha:
i'd like to send this parcel, please.

person beta:
what's in it, please?

person alpha:
some books and newspapers.

person beta:
ok. please fill in this form and label it.

person alpha:
is it all right?

person beta:
yeah. and would you like to mail it by air?

person alpha:
no, i'd rather send it by sea.

person beta:
thirteen yuan, please. here is the receipt and change.

person alpha:
thank you.

person beta:
you are welcome.

person alpha:
but ernie, we're still missing something. we need someone to play the music!

person beta:
oh right... you know, my friend eric is a dj. maybe he would like to play with us.

person alpha:
hmm... does he have a good ear for hip hop music?

person beta:
well, i don't know, but we can find out. we can talk to him and ask if he wants to join our group.

person alpha:
excuse me, is there any room available? i want a single one.

person beta:
yes. when do you want it?

person alpha:
next today. by the way, is there a closed circuit tv?

person beta:
yes, sir.

person alpha:
what about laundry?

person beta:
sorry, sir. you have to pay by yourself.

person alpha:
what time does the museum close? any idea?

person beta:
i'm not sure, but i think it's open until 4 o'clock.

person alpha:
what time is it now?

person beta:
it's a quarter past three.

person alpha:
i would like to buy some local handcrafts as gifts to my friends and relatives.

person beta:
there are many stores selling handcrafts in paris. our store is wellknown for vase, table wear and jewelry boxes. you can take your time and choose whatever you like.

person alpha:
well, the tapestry is delicate and beautiful.

person beta:
you have made an excellent choice, it is our newcomer. the tapestry is on hot sell with the design and quality. the design on it is traditional paris architecture.

person alpha:
how much is it?

person beta:
100 frances.

person alpha:
mmm, it is reasonable. look at this set of table wear, it is so beautiful!

person beta:
we have a piece of table clothing to go with it. it is a brocade one with pretty stars.

person alpha:
this silver vase is a good ornament for the living room.

person beta:
you are right.

person alpha:
i will take the tapestry, the set of table wear and the vase.

person beta:
ok. do you like these candles? they are on sale now.

person alpha:
all right. i will take one.

person beta:
it's so boring.

person alpha:
don't you like it?

person beta:
i don't. is there anything worth watching on the other channel?

person alpha:
i think it's a basketball match on channel 5.

person beta:
do you mind if we switch over?

person alpha:
well, i'd rather see a movie.

person beta:
what's the movie?

person alpha:
'star war'.

person beta:
it must be interesting.

person alpha:
yes, you're right.

person beta:
where can i get my baggage?

person alpha:
are you from a domestic flight or an international one?

person beta:
an international one from seattle.

person alpha:
in that case, you should go to the baggage hall over there.

person beta:
oh yes, i see the sign, thank you.

person alpha:
man! that car almost hit me!

person beta:
yeah, that was close.

person alpha:
excuse me.

person beta:
yes?

person alpha:
could you tell me where the copy room is?

person beta:
sure. you just walk down this hallway. the copy room is the second room on the right.

person alpha:
doctor, save my baby, please

person beta:
what symptoms does he have?

person alpha:
he has had a fever for one day. just now at home, he had febrile convulsions with teeth and fists clenched and eyes turned up. we were at a loss what to do. we called an ambulance and brought the baby here.

person beta:
how long did the convulsion last?

person alpha:
about 3 minutes.

person beta:
does he have any other complaints?

person alpha:
three days ago, he began to cough, sneeze and have a running nose. yesterday, he began to have a fever.

person beta:
have you taken his temperature?

person alpha:
it was 38 deg c this morning and it was 39 deg c just now.

person beta:
let me examine him to see if there is any rash. no rash.

person alpha:
is it serious? is it meningitis?

person beta:
no, it is not meningitis. just a high fever and convulsions, which results from a virus upper respiratory tract inflection.

person alpha:
does he have to be admitted to hospital?

person beta:
no. no need for admission. i'll give the baby analgia nose drops to bring down the temperature first. then i will give you a prescription. the pink tablets are used for his fever. when his temperature is over 38 deg c, give him one tablet. the other tablets are sedatives for his convulsions. the white liquid is for the cold. give the baby plenty of water to drink.

person alpha:
thank you very much, doctor.

person beta:
jack! do you want to see a picture of my new puppy?

person alpha:
sure. i thought people only showed off pictures of their new babies, not new pets!

person beta:
well, this is my new baby. he's just as much trouble. that's for sure! but, he's a lot of fun!

person alpha:
i see what you mean. he's really cute. how old is he?

person beta:
thank you for organizing this great baby shower for me! i've always been to baby showers but never actually had one held for me! let's get started!

person alpha:
ok, let's start opening some presents!

person beta:
oh look! what a great little bib for the baby! this will definitely come in handy! oh wow, you also got me a stroller! that's so great! thank you!

person alpha:
this next one is from betty.

person beta:
a highchair and car seat! wow betty, thank you so much! i really appreciate it!

person alpha:
one more from carla.

person beta:
a playpen and crib! thanks carla! this is just what i needed!

person alpha:
ok, that's all of them. no more gifts. now who wants to guess when the baby is due?

person beta:
umm. i think my water just broke! get me to a hospital!

person alpha:
wow, this is amazing. i'm glad we've come here. so cool.

person beta:
i always love skiing. you know, it's a cool game for cool people. stay with me and you will be cool, too.

person alpha:
hey, look over there. it seems that there is something interesting going on. let's go and have a look.

person beta:
sure. it's probably the skiing show. adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors.

person alpha:
see that. it's so dangerous. my mom would never allow me to do that.

person beta:
hey, don't be so pathetic. it's a maximal sports show. what else can they do to attract more visitors? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show.

person alpha:
you are right. but what if the avalanche happened?

person beta:
they are all very experienced and great skiers. so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim.

person alpha:
anyway, the show is breathtaking. by the way, where did they get so much snow in here?

person beta:
don't you know that? are you kidding me?

person alpha:
hey, not everyone is as lucky as you to have a father who is a scientist.

person beta:
sorry. well, they have the most advanced snowmaking machine.

person alpha:
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution?

person beta:
it's possible. but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can.

person alpha:
it's a good thing. ok, let's go skiing.

person beta:
here we go.

person alpha:
would you like a smoking or non-smoking room?

person beta:
non-smoking, please.

person alpha:
good morning! may i help you?

person beta:
yes. my wife and i are interested in renting a house for the summer.

person alpha:
do you want a furnished house or an unfurnished one?

person beta:
furnished.

person alpha:
very well. how long do you want the house? all summer?

person beta:
no, not all summer. just for six weeks.

person alpha:
i'm afraid i can only rent it for two months.

person beta:
my holiday is only six weeks, but i think my brother and his family would take it for the other two weeks.is the house in good condition?

person alpha:
yes, it is. it was just painted and it has all the modern conveniences.

person beta:
hello. capital hotel. may i help you?

person alpha:
yes, unlikely my flight will be 2 hours due to the fog. would you please keep my reservation?

person alpha:
that's good to hear. you've had an ideal recovery from your operation. we're going to send you home tomorrow.

person beta:
do you think i can get back to work very soon?

person alpha:
don't be in such a hurry. i'm confident that you'll be completely recovered in 4 to 6 weeks.

person beta:
is there anything i should do?

person alpha:
you'd better have a good rest for a week. be sure to have regular meals. stay away from alcohol.give up smoking at least a little while.

person beta:
should i take some medicine?

person alpha:
yes. i'm going to give you some.take one tablet of this medicine three times a day before meals. for that one, two tablets. and remember to come to the out patient department for a consultation in two weeks, please.

person beta:
it's very kind of you.

person alpha:
you're welcome. we wish you a speedy recovery.goodbye.

person beta:
sir, would you like some dessert now?

person alpha:
please show me the menu again.

person beta:
here you are. sir, the chocolate cake is very delicious.

person alpha:
no, thanks. i don't like chocolate. i'd like strawberry pie.

person beta:
i am afraid there is none.

person alpha:
then i'll have vanilla ice cream.

person beta:
fine. i will bring it right away.

person alpha:
bruno bistro, how may i help you?

person beta:

four people.

person alpha:
lastly, may i please know what name i should make the reservation under?

person beta:

these two are urgent letters and should be sent by registered express airmail. others are ordinary letters.

person beta:

person alpha:
it's sent to mr. charles. i believe he is in london.

person beta:
ok, home or office address?

person alpha:
office address, please. he might be at work when they arrive.

person beta:
should i enclose this commercial paper with these two letters?

person alpha:
yes, it's right.

person beta:
well, randy, i'd say you've got a bad case of the flu. the main thing to do is get plenty of rest and drink lots of liquids. i'll prescribe something for that throat.

person alpha:
thanks, doctor. is there anything i can take for this headache?

person beta:
some aspirin or panadol should help. you can pick some up at the pharmacy when you go to fill your prescription.

person alpha:
okay.

person beta:
goodbye, randy. take care.

person alpha:
good morning. madam. how can i help?

person beta:
i'd like to take some money from my fund account at the securities company. is that possible here?

person alpha:
certainly. we can transfer the money straight into your bank account here and then you can withdraw it right away. could i have your passbook for bank-securities account transfer?

person beta:
here it is. could i make a balance enquiry, please?

person alpha:
your balance today is 120,376 rib.

person beta:
fine, i'll take 10,000 rib, please.

person alpha:
ok. please fill in this form and input you code here... and again, please. i'll just check and see if the money has been transferred. yes, transaction successful.

person beta:
thank you very much.

person alpha:
hello, can i speak to tom, please?

person beta:
i'm afraid he is not in at the moment.

person alpha:
may i ask what time he will come back?

person beta:
i think he will come back at 3 p. m. do you want to call later? or would you like to leave a message for him?

person alpha:
i'd like to leave a message. please ask him to call me back as soon as he returns. i'm a and he has my number.

excuse me, i've been waiting my main dish for quite a time.

person beta:
yes sir, just a minute, please. i'll check with the kitchen. thank you for waiting. it takes another 10 to 15 minutes, i'm afraid.

person alpha:
i have an appointment in half an hour.

person beta:
i see.

person alpha:
do you have anything else i can have instead?

person beta:
well sir, yes. how about this stew? we can serve you at once.

person alpha:
i'll take this stew then.

person beta:
do you want to talk with john with tongue?

person alpha:
no, tell him i'm tied up.

person beta:
when should i tell him to call back?

person alpha:
tell him to call me tomorrow morning.

person beta:
all right.

person alpha:
thank you.

person beta:
now people are talking about world recession which started more than a year ago. can you give us your personal assessment of the situation of the global economy?

person alpha:
as you know, we are in a very special time. this is a very hard time for many countries'economics, both developed and developing. i think the current economic situation could be described as synchronized slowdown of major economies.

person beta:
what is the direct impact of the terrorist attack upon your country's economy?

person alpha:
once the us economy is in trouble due to the terrorist attack, the impact could be quickly felt in the rest of the world.

person beta:
what challenges is your country's economy facing at the moment?

person alpha:
we do face a lot of challenges because there is still much uncertainty about the world economy. it's very important for us to strike a proper balance between investment in fixed assets and household consumption.

person beta:
so, what do you plan to do today?

person alpha:
there is a matisse exhibition at the museum of modern art. larry and i will go.

person beta:
did you buy tickets already?

person alpha:
no. do we need tickets?

person beta:
well, probably. probably you will have to wait in line if you don't have tickets.

person alpha:
outside or inside?

person beta:
outside, on the sidewalk.

person alpha:
hmm. it's very cold today.but i brought my jacket. maybe it will be alright to wait.

person beta:
the myoma is very popular. there will be a lot of people.

person alpha:
myoma? what's that?

person beta:
oh, sorry.it stands for the museum of modern art. it's an acronym. m o m a myoma.

person alpha:
i see. do you have any suggestions for other things we should do?

person beta:
i suggest you go to the jewish museum.it's not far from the guggenheim, near central park. it is really very interesting.also, there is a great museum of medieval european art further up north.it's called the cloisters.

person alpha:
how can we get up there?

person beta:
you can take a bus.

person alpha:
but larry says the neighborhoods in the north are dangerous.

person beta:
finally we have a long holiday.

person alpha:
yes, what about us having a tour?

person beta:
good idea. where shall we go?

person alpha:
how about milan?

person beta:
great. shall we go alone or as part of the group?

person alpha:
why not travel by ourselves?

person beta:
hello. this is john's distribution. can i help you?

person alpha:
yes. i need some ice water delivered.

person beta:
are you completely out?

person alpha:
no, i have some, but not enough for the long weekend.

person beta:
okay. i'll send someone to deliver it for you tomorrow.

person alpha:
thank you.

person beta:
no problem.

person alpha:
please come in and sit down. i'm happy to finally meet you.

person beta:
same here. i've been looking forward to this.

person alpha:
i'm sorry i kept you waiting so long. i'm running a little late today.

person beta:
no problem. that happens to all of us, it goes badly with the traffic.

person alpha:
thank you. can i offer you some refreshment?

person beta:
why not, thank you. a little tea would be nice.

person alpha:
i'm here to conduct the annual census of foreigners living in beijing. this is my service id card.

person beta:
ok. what do you want to know?

person alpha:
we only need to verify your information against our records.

person beta:
ok.

person alpha:
please show me your passport and residence permit.

person beta:
here you are.

person alpha:
how long have you been living here?

person beta:
two years.

person alpha:

person beta:
i'm a professor at a university.

person alpha:

person beta:
i teach at beijing normal university, english composition and some conversational classes.

person alpha:
everything appears to be in order. thank you for your time.

person beta:
do you wash clothes here often?

person alpha:
i have been coming here for the past few years.

person beta:
why do you wash here?

person alpha:
it's actually a lot cheaper for me to wash my clothes here.

person beta:
i've only washed my clothes here a couple times.

person alpha:
why don't you wash clothes at home?

person beta:
i would, if my washing machine wasn't broken.

person alpha:
why don't you just get it fixed?

person beta:
i can't afford it.

person alpha:
so you plan on washing your clothes here from now on?

person beta:
that's my only option right now.

person alpha:
don't worry. besides, it's a lot cheaper to wash clothes this way.

person beta:
francis, you have done an outstanding work in the past six months. in view of your achievement, i trust you're now indispensable part of our company and you deserve an officer director title.

person alpha:
i am so happy to know that i could make some contribution to our company.

person beta:
this title does not only give you a raising pay-check, but also increase responsibilities. congratulations, and hope the best for you.

person alpha:
thank you, i will be doing my best.

person beta:
i've brought this dress back to exchange it.

person alpha:
that's not a problem. leave it with me, and find something that you like.

person beta:
i was hoping you'd have something on sale today.

person alpha:
we have nothing on sale today. but we're having a big sale next weekend.

person beta:
is the sale going to include dresses?

person alpha:
everything you can see will be on sale.

person beta:
i like the sound of that. i'll just come back next weekend.

person alpha:
the savings will be worth the short wait. see you next weekend.

person beta:
good afternoon, sir.what can i do for you?

person alpha:
well. i can't find my key now. i think i have lost it.

person beta:

person beta:

when is a good time to catch him?

person alpha:
in about twenty minutes.

person beta:

person alpha:

yes, please.

person alpha:
here you are.

person beta:

person alpha:

what brand do you prefer?

person beta:
an ordinary one will do.would you put me under a hot dryer after that? i'm in a hurry.

person alpha:
all right, miss.this one is very hot. i'll come to turn it off in fifteen minutes.will that be alright?

person beta:
ok.

person alpha:
come on. don't cheat on me. it's a long shot.

person beta:
it's true. you should be happy about that.

person alpha:
i can't make out anything, the words are too light. i thought they have already changed the toner cartridge this month.

person beta:
it seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax.

person alpha:
ok, no problem. we do it ourselves.

person beta:
do you know how to do it? i am not so good at machine things. i will have somebody do it as soon as possible.

person alpha:
check with somebody from the it department. they are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment.

person beta:
what should i do to prepare for a job interview?

person alpha:
an understanding of the basic workings of a company and the services or goods it provides is essential. do you have that?

person beta:
sort of, but i could know more, i guess.

person alpha:
with that understanding, you can figure out what your company is looking for in terms of basic attitude. right?

person beta:
i think that they are a very formal company.

person alpha:
what you wear is important. so keep in mind what is suitable for the company and type of work you will be doing. need help?

person beta:
i need a lot of help in this area.

person alpha:
in addition to clothes we need to think about other basics, ok?

person beta:
yes, what else should we think of?

person alpha:
be prompt. don't forget to be friendly and interested. listen carefully and listen to what they are really asking you. you'll be a hit!

person beta:
what are your responsibilities as a secretary?

person alpha:
i did only simple things in the office, such as tidying up the office, serving tea, typing and filing, and so on.

person beta:
what courses did you take in english secretarial studies?

person alpha:
i took such courses as secretarial principles, office administration, business english, and public relations.

person beta:
hello. where are you headed today?

person alpha:
i'm off to barcelona for a week.

person beta:
do you have your passport with you?

person alpha:
yes, here you go. i don't need a visa to go to spain, do i?

person beta:
fortunately for you, you don't. next time, if you have any questions about visas, you should try to find out before you get to the airport.

person alpha:
that's good advice.

person beta:
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat?

person alpha:
are there any seats available by the emergency exits?

person beta:
let me see here... yes, there's one left.

person alpha:
ok. i'll take that one then.

person beta:
alright. how many pieces of luggage are you checking in?

person alpha:
i like to travel light so i just have this one.

person beta:
if that's your only piece of luggage, it is small enough to carry on with you. would you like to do that so you don't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive?

person alpha:
yes, please. that's a fantastic idea. which gate do i need to go to?

person beta:
you're here a bit early, so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about a half hour. here's your boarding pass. enjoy your flight!

person alpha:
all right. i want to bring everybody in on this project. when can we start working on this?

person beta:
well, we could probably get started with a strategy meeting tomorrow morning at 8

person alpha:
i tell you what, 800 is no good for me, but why don't you guys get started and i'll come by at around 8

person beta:
that's fine with me. how much time are we going to have to work on this?

person alpha:
i need a pan.

person beta:
okay. do you have a particular size in mind?

person alpha:
well, the bigger the better, i think.

person beta:
look at this one. it's our biggest pan.

person alpha:
yes, that is big enough, but it's too heavy for me.

person beta:
okay, we have the same thing in aluminum.

person alpha:
oh, this is nice and light. but it has an aluminum handle.

person beta:
try this one. same aluminum pan, but with a heat-resistant bamboo handle.

person alpha:
oh, yes. this is very nice. i'll take this one.

person beta:
that's a good choice. how do you want to pay for it?

person alpha:
cash. oh, i almost forgot. i need a lid, too.

person beta:
i'm so sorry. a lid comes with the pan. here it is.

person alpha:
well, mr. smith. that's a nasty infection you have.

person beta:
yes. is there anything you can give me to get rid of it, doctor?

person alpha:
i'm going to prescribe some antibiotics, and some cream to ease the itching and burning.

person beta:
ok. thank you. where should i buy them?

person alpha:
the pharmacy will give you a discount since you came to the clinic.

person beta:
great. what floor is the pharmacy on?

person alpha:
the fourth. i'll send the prescription down there, so you can just pick it up on your way out.

person beta:
thank you.

person alpha:
our factory locates at a village in the east of the city. the area of it is 3,600 square meters.

person beta:
we'd like to visit the factory. can you show me the way?

person alpha:
that's ok! we'll take you to have a tour. please follow me.

person beta:
how many shifts are there in your factory?

person alpha:
there are two shifts now in total.

person beta:
what about your company's qc management?

person alpha:
we established the strict qc standards and we have followed it for about five years with good results.

person beta:
where are the workers from? from the villages nearby?

person alpha:
most of them live in the city. we provide free commuter buses for the workers. besides, we built the dormitory building for the workers on night shift.

person beta:
it sounds nice. we can't wait to visiting the factory.

person alpha:
my toothache started nearly a month ago. the pain's been keeping me awake. would you please have a look?

person beta:
open your mouth, please. which one?

person alpha:
the one right at the back.

person beta:
i'm afraid we can't save that one. it will have to come out.

person alpha:
will it hurt much?

person beta:
i'll give you an injection, then you won't feel pain.

person alpha:
( 5 minutes later) ok, it's all over. spit there and bite the cotton ball tightly in place for half an hour.

person beta:
it's raining heavily.

person alpha:
we have to find a shelter.

person beta:
all right.

person alpha:
let's go under the tree.

person beta:
no, we can't. it's thundering.

person alpha:
then let's go to that store.

person beta:

person alpha:
one second, sir, while i print out your receipt. here you are.

person beta:

person beta:
well, except for one night, i enjoyed the hotel. and i loved new york, of course.

person alpha:
thank you for your honesty. i assure you there will be no cockroaches next time.

person beta:
have you attended school today?

person alpha:
i attended school today. did you?

person beta:
i wasn't able to attend school because i was feeling ill.

person alpha:
i'm sorry to hear that. would you like the assignments from english class?

person beta:
i would really appreciate that, thanks.

person alpha:
it's no trouble at all.

person beta:
if you get sick, i'll return the favor.

person alpha:
thanks. see you at school tomorrow if you feel better.

person beta:

person beta:
i understand.

person alpha:
well, mr. smith. that's a nasty infection you have.

person beta:
yes. is there anything you can give me to get rid of it, doctor?

person alpha:
i'm going to prescribe some antibiotics and some cream to ease the itching and burning.

person beta:
ok, thank you! where should i buy them?

person alpha:
the pharmacy will give you a discount since you came to the clinic.

person beta:
great! what floor is pharmacy on?

person alpha:
the fourth. i'll send the prescription down there so you can just pick it up on your way out.

person beta:
thank you!

person alpha:
how can i help you?

person beta:
well, i'm looking for some summer clothes.

person alpha:
oh, it is the right time for you purchasing in our clothes shop. we are now having a low price on all our summer apparel.

person beta:
really? what's that?

person alpha:
everything for summer is 20% off.

person beta:
i like this t-shirt. would you like to help me look for any skirts that go with it?

person alpha:
sure. we have both skirts and trousers that would look well with the t-shirt. look at this section.

person beta:
this one is good.

person alpha:
you have good taste. it is very much in style this year.

person beta:

person beta:
i got it from the cafeteria.

person alpha:
what kind of sandwich did you get?

person beta:
they messed up my order and gave me a bologna sandwich.

person alpha:
how was it?

person beta:
considering it wasn't what i ordered, it was still pretty good.

person alpha:
i think i got a sandwich there once before.

person beta:
really?

person alpha:
yes, and they didn't get my order right either.

person beta:
could you project what you would like to be doing five years from now?

person alpha:
as i have some administrative experience from my last job, i may use my organizational and planning skills in the future.

person beta:
how do you plan to accomplish this?

person alpha:
by doing everything necessary and for further study.

person beta:
how long would you like to stay with this company?

person alpha:
how long i will stay with the company depends on whether the company and i are satisfied with each other.

person beta:
what do you think of this industry's outlook in five years?

person alpha:
i do believe this industry will be developed rapidly in 5 years time.

person beta:
hello? this is john smith.can i speak to mr.white, please?

person alpha:
this is mr.white speaking.

person beta:

i got stuck in a traffic jam.

person alpha:
hurry up, the show is about to start.

person beta:
it looks like you're very interested in the circus.

person alpha:
yes, i love to see the animal show.

person beta:
i have never seen those before, but since you're so excited it should be good.

person alpha:
i'm sure you'll love it.

person beta:
okay, i will go and get some popcorn first.

person alpha:

person beta:
help yourself.

person alpha:
what's the matter?

person beta:
checking out, please.

person alpha:
can i have your keys, please? thank you. here's your statement.

person beta:
excuse me. what are these charges?

person alpha:
oh, these are the phone charges and these are for something from the bar.

person beta:
wait a minute. i made a phone call, but i never made a connection.

person alpha:
i know, sir. those aren't telephone company charges. those are hotel charges.

person beta:
isn't that a bit excessive?

person alpha:
i'm sorry, sir. it's our policy.

person beta:
ok. here is the money.

person alpha:
thank you. welcome to our hotel again.

person beta:
can i help you, sir?

person alpha:
yes, i'd like to look at some suits.

person beta:
oh, this way please. what size do you wear?

person alpha:
size 41. i want something in dark flannel.

person beta:
how about this one?

person alpha:
it feels all right. but if it were a darker color, i'd like it better. this seems too light for winter. do you think you could get me one?

person beta:
all right. i'll show you something darker. do you like this one?

person alpha:
it looks good. but can i try it on?

person beta:
of course. let me help you.

person alpha:
thanks. it's comfortable. well, how much is it, please?

person beta:
$ 280.

person alpha:
ok. i'll take it. here's the money.

person beta:
mike, you're seventeen years old, right?

person alpha:
yeah, why?

person beta:
you look quite mature beside your cousin who is eighteen.

person alpha:
you can bet on that.

person beta:
come in and sit down.

person alpha:
thanks, mr. liang.

person beta:
among all the assistants, i think you're on top of it. based on the annual evaluation, the board of directors decided to give you a bonus.

person alpha:
really? i am too happy.

person beta:
i've been reviewing your work over the past few months. thanks to your excellent work, we benefit much from your project. and you should get the perfect attendance award too.

person alpha:
thanks for your trust. owing to my colleagues'help, i've successfully completed my task.

person beta:
you are very modest and diligent. the distribution of bonus derived from the performance evaluation. you deserve it.

person alpha:
thank you very much. i will redouble my efforts in the future.

person beta:
donna! how are you? it's good to hear your voice.

person alpha:
thank you. jack, it's always a pleasure doing business with you.

person beta:
so how are things in the land of the free and the home of brave?

person alpha:
great! and, how are things in your neck of the woods?

person beta:
things are so great here. i almost smiled myself to death last week. one of my coworkers had to give me cpr.

person alpha:
oh.jack, i have missed your sense of humor.ha ha ha! nobody else sees things quite like you do.it's your gift.

person beta:
or a curse.

person alpha:
nope, it's a gift.anyway, we need some more of those mid-range speakers you tricked me into buying last time.

person beta:
that, my dear, was classic sales technique delivered by a professional.

person alpha:
are you still gouging your customers the same price per unit?

person beta:
heck no, we doubled the price, but because it's you, i'll let you have'em at 50 off.

person alpha:
you silver-tongued devil. can't you ever just answer a question with a simple yes or no?

person beta:
i could, but where's the fun in that?

person alpha:
hi. i'm here for flight 514 returning to beijing but the board shows there is a delay.how long of a delay is expected?

person beta:
so far it looks like we will be leaving two hours late, but keep checking the departing flights status board just in case.

person alpha:
do you think it's safe to leave to get a quick bite?

person beta:
i think you should stay in the airport. even though the delay is expected to be two hours, the flight departure could be announced any minute. who knows?

person alpha:
what seems to be the problem?

person beta:
it seems there are some loose bolts on one of the wings. it happens all the time. no need to worry.

person alpha:
umm... you know... actually i was thinking of trying another airline. no need to hold my seat.

person beta:
i need to go to the atm.

person alpha:
so, why don't you?

person beta:
i have no idea how to use the atm.

person alpha:
what do you mean?

person beta:
this will be my first time using an atm.

person alpha:
i can help you with that.

person beta:
explain to me how to use it.

person alpha:
just put your card into the machine.

person beta:
now what do i do?

person alpha:
then you need to type in your pin.

person beta:
now what?

person alpha:
just click on one of the choices they give you, and that's it.

person beta:
would you like something to drink?

person alpha:
yes please. do you have any teas?

person beta:
of course we have lots of teas?

person alpha:
what do you recommend?

person beta:
what about a green tea or perhaps a jasmine tea?

person alpha:
what's this one?

person beta:
that's oolong tea- it's a cantonese tea.

person alpha:
ok, i'll try that.

person beta:
may, is this the hall of ancient china?

person alpha:
yes. look at these historical relics here, amazing!

person beta:
why are they all in glass boxes?

person alpha:
for protection. some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air.

person beta:
so there isn't air in the glass boxes?

person alpha:
no, there isn't. they are all vacuumed.

person beta:
i wonder how old these things are, thousands of years?

person alpha:
yeah, they all come from a very ancient time.

person beta:
hey, look at the three-leg cup. i've seen it on tv.

person alpha:
the bronze cup was made 4,000 years ago. it's priceless!

person beta:
yeah, it has no value at all. who will use this cup today?

person alpha:
danny, priceless means so valuable that you can't put a price on it.

person beta:
oh, it does?

person alpha:
i am so worried about this english contest. i have butterflies in my stomach now!

person beta:
i have confidence in you. believe in yourself.

person alpha:
what would you like on your pizzas?

person beta:
we want one vegetarian supreme and one double pepperoni.

person alpha:
would you like anything to drink with that? for$ 1.50, you can get a two-liter bottle of coke.

person beta:
no, thanks.

person alpha:
all right. that'll be$ 12.50. your pizzas will be there in 30 minutes.

person beta:
thanks.

person alpha:
we are redecorating and i'm going to add some things.

person beta:
well, i'll be glad to help you out. we can deliver what you need to your office.

person alpha:
shall we meet at 1:15 this thursday? we definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit.

person beta:
fine, i'll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on thursday.

person alpha:
can you tell me the way to library?

person beta:
sure, turn left at the next crossing.

person alpha:
is it on xinhua street?

person beta:
yes. you can't miss it.

person alpha:
comfort inn, may i help you?

person beta:
i'm looking for a hotel near the convention center.

person alpha:
you're in luck! we're just a two-minute drive from there. would you like to make a reservation?

person beta:
not just yet. i have one or two questions. how much for a single?

person alpha:
during the peak season, a single room goes for 50 dollars on a night. but we've got a single super saver special going on right now- only$ 30 a night. and we've also extended our checkout time 00 in

person beta:
that's a good deal. since this is a working trip, i wonder if you have meeting rooms where i can get together with some clients.

person alpha:
yes, we have five meeting rooms, of various sizes. we can accommodate large meetings and small, informal gatherings as well. of course, if you have many small meeting, you might consider checking

person beta:
that sounds great. do you accept checks?

person alpha:
i'm sorry, sir, we don't. but we do accept all major credit cards.

person beta:
i am sorry to trouble you, but there's a lot of noise in the next room.

person alpha:
oh, is there? which room is it?

person beta:
it's. i think, neighbours on the right.

person alpha:
you mean the room thirteen-thirteen?

person beta:
i'm not sure, but i think so. i'm very exhausted, but i can't sleep.

person alpha:
all right, ma'am. i'll check and tell them to be quiet.

person beta:
if next room is still noisy, could you give me a different room, please?

person alpha:
have you ever been to xi'an?

person beta:
yes, i've been there several times on business trips. but i have never really seen the terra-cotta warriors as it is outside the city.

person alpha:
i've heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring. i really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day. of course i won't miss the local food either. you know, the sites interests a food in scenery, food is a key factor when visiting a place.

person beta:
i agree. as long as the food is not too bizarre once i saw some people eating insects. that is frightening.

person alpha:
sure it is. is it convenient to get there by plane?

person beta:
well, the airport is quite far from the downtown area, but it is still more convenient than taking the train.

person alpha:
a ticket to london, please.

person beta:
a cheap day return ticket?

person alpha:
yes, including london tube.

person beta:
that'll be twelve pounds.

person alpha:
doctor, what is the best way to stay healthy?

person beta:
having a good diet is probably the most important thing.

person alpha:
it is very confusing to know what to eat.

person beta:
you need plenty of fruits and vegetables, small amounts of protein, and whole grains.

person alpha:
are there certain things that i should avoid?

person beta:
you shouldn't consume too much sugar or caffeine. also, watch your intake of fatty food.

person alpha:
after watching my diet, what else should i do?

person beta:
you need to stop smoking, and make sure that you get 30 minutes of exercise every day.

person alpha:
can i have a glass of wine now and then?

person beta:
as long as you don't overdo it, a glass of wine a day should be ok.

person alpha:
darling, i am back. what are you doing?

person beta:
i am washing clothes. are you hungry now? wait for a moment, i'll cook dinner for you.( steven bends his brows)

person alpha:
b, should we get a maid?

person beta:
i can do all the housework. we don't need a maid.

person alpha:
you have worked very hard in the office. if we can get someone to help you, you can have more rest.

person beta:
we really don't need to.

person alpha:
you are a good wife, julia. but you must take care of yourself.

person beta:
give me some time to think about it.

person alpha:
can i reserve a room from the 13th to the 18th?

person beta:
certainly. how do you like your room?

person alpha:
i'd like a suite. what's the rate?

person beta:
$ 40 per night.

person alpha:
is there anything i can do for you?

person beta:
excuse me, can i change my order? i am afraid i don't have so much time to enjoy my dinner.

person alpha:
i am sorry, sir. your fish will be ready in five minutes so you can't change it.

person beta:
that's all right.

person alpha:

person beta:
guangzhou university.

person alpha:
what degree did you receive?

person beta:
i received a bachelor's degree in economics.

person alpha:
what courses did you take in college?

person beta:
my major courses were microeconomics, macroeconomics, international trade, international finance, world economy, psychology and business english

person alpha:
why did you choose to study economics?

person beta:
because i was quite interested in economics then.

person alpha:
can you speak other languages except english?

person beta:
i can also speak a little japanese.

person alpha:
i am very satisfied with your answers.

person beta:
thank you very much.

person alpha:
once you arrive at the american airport, please call me.

person beta:
ok, don't worry about it. i will.

person alpha:
take care of yourself.

person beta:
sorry, mary, i can't make it in time for dinner.

person alpha:
okay, bob, when will i see you?

person beta:
maybe i will be around later.

person alpha:
okay, i'll see you later.

person beta:
i am sorry, sir. i have broken the reading lamp in my room.

person alpha:
well, sir. may i have your room number?

person beta:
503. i would like to pay for it.

person alpha:
please fill out the form first.

person beta:
ok, can you bring me a new one?

person alpha:
of course.

person beta:
excuse me. i need to refill this prescription.

person alpha:
it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills.

person beta:
yes, i need to refill it today.

person alpha:
alright. i'm sorry, miss. according to our file, this prescription has already been refilled twice.

person beta:
i was worried about that. i couldn't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not.

person alpha:
well, it looks like you have.you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription.

person beta:
listen. this is an emergency. i tried to call my doctor, but he is out of town. so i can't see him in time. i need this medicine. it is for skin condition. i've run out.can you just refill it once more?

person alpha:
i'm sorry, miss. we can't do it. we must follow the prescription.and this prescription has run out.

person beta:
but i need it. please. refill it for me just this once. i can go to the doctor around ten days from now. then i'll have another prescription.

person alpha:
miss, i understand your problem.but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription.it's the law. i can't do anything about it.we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription. never.

person beta:
but i have a prescription. i just need more of it.

person alpha:
a prescription must be valid. it cannot be an expired prescription. i'm sorry, miss. it's the law.you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you.

person beta:
oh, it will be so expensive! i have a special medical plan, and i can only see one doctor.it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor.

person alpha:
miss, i just can't help you on this. i'm a pharmacist, not a doctor. and there are other customers i need to help now. i know it is frustrating when this happens.but there is nothing i can do about it. i'm sorry.

person beta:
this is ridiculous! in taiwan, it is much easier to get medicine when i need it.

person alpha:
maybe that's true. i don't know.but i'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too.

person beta:
what are you doing?

person alpha:
i'm trying to put the vase on the shelf.

person beta:
let regive you a hand.

person alpha:
no, thank you. i can manage it, i think.

person beta:
there are so many record players here. that is hard to choose.

person alpha:
look at this one. it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers.

person beta:
i'd rather get one with separated speakers.they give a clear sound.

person alpha:
yes, but we shouldn't get any thing too big. remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture.

person beta:
that's right. now this one looks alright? it's a detached or do you prefer this one? it's sony.

person alpha:
let's ask the salesmen for a demonstration.

person beta:
ahhchooo!

person alpha:
you've been sneezing a lot lately. are you sick or something?

person beta:
no. every spring time around april, i'm stricken with allergies.

person alpha:
i never have seasonal allergies.

person beta:
consider yourself lucky.

person alpha:
what are all the symptoms?

person beta:
well, as you just saw, i sneeze a lot. also, my nose becomes very runny, my throat sometimes itches, and my eyes start to water.

person alpha:
that doesn't sound good.

person beta:
no, it's not. so you don't have any type of allergies?

person alpha:
well, i have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol. it runs in the family.

person beta:
everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol.

person alpha:
i get it pretty bad. my whole face turns red, including my ears. my eyes become bloodshot, and i start to itch all over my body.

person beta:
that's pretty bad.

person alpha:
but that doesn't stop me from drinking. ahahah.

person beta:
let's have a look at the map first.

person alpha:
all right. wukesong stop is quite a few stops from here.

person beta:
let's buy some tickets.

person alpha:
the train is coming. there are a lot of people waiting here. let's stand in a better position to get on the train

person beta:
well, it's not as crowded as we expected, is it?

person alpha:
no, but it will be soon. look, there're two empty seats over there. let's get them.

person beta:
what do you do?

person alpha:
i'm an apprentice with a local engineering firm. my training lasts for two years. two days a week i study engineering at a local college. if i pass all my exams, i hope the company will take me on as an engineer.

person beta:
i want to keep a pet, but i don't know which one to buy?

person alpha:
dogs are nice, but they are really energetic, and you need to make sure they get enough exercise every day.

person beta:
having a dog would probably be too much work for me, then.

person alpha:
what about cats? they are more independent.

person beta:
actually, i was thinking of something a little more exotic. i don't want a common pet like a dog or a cat.

person alpha:
how about a lizard? are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting?

person beta:
yeah, are they easy to look after?

person alpha:
yeah, they are pretty low-maintenance; they eat almost anything.

person beta:
can i be of any service to you?

person alpha:
i've been told that chinese arts and crafts are famous for their excellent workmanship. we'd like to take some home. what would you recommend?

person beta:
there are over a thousands kinds of articles in our shop.for example, there is tricolored pottery originating in the tang dynasty, embroidery, batik, jade carving, just to name a few.do you have anything in mind?

person alpha:
no, not really.but i think it should be something distinctively chinese. and easy to carry.

person beta:
i would suggest you buy paper-cuts, embroidery and batik.they are very easy to carry.

person alpha:
so, we'd like to see some embroidery.

person beta:
hey, mary. we're back. have you eaten yet?

person alpha:
i had some bread for breakfast.

person beta:
let's go out for brunch.

person alpha:
brunch?

person beta:
it is a meal that combines breakfast and lunch. on sundays, many americans sleep late and go out for brunch. those who go to church without having breakfast have brunch also.

person alpha:
actually, many taiwanese wake up late on sunday mornings, too. it may be a good idea for them to eat brunch instead of eating breakfast and lunch.

person beta:
hi, my name is sovia.what's your name?

person alpha:
my name is jeff.

person beta:
what do you do?

person alpha:
i'm a podiatrist. what about you?

person beta:
i'm a nurse.what do you do in your free time?

person alpha:
i like to play piano, go bowling and chat with my friends.and you?

person beta:
i like to hang out with my friends, play games and go swimming.

person alpha:
would you like to go out some time?

person beta:
sure, that'd be great.where would you like to go?

person alpha:
anywhere with you.

person beta:
aren't you sweet.

person alpha:
oh, i'm starving. i'd like to try some real chinese cuisine. what would you recommend, waiter?

person beta:
well, it depends. you see, there are eight famous chinese for instance, the sichuan cuisine, and the hunan cuisine.

person alpha:
they are both spicy hot, i've heard.

person beta:
that's right. if you like hot dishes, you could try some.

person alpha:
they might be too hot for me.

person beta:
then there's the cantonese cuisine and the kiangsu cuisine. most southerners like them.

person alpha:
what about any special beijing dishes?

person beta:
there's the beijing roast duck.

person alpha:
oh, yes. i've heard a lot about it. i'd like very much to try it. where can i find it?

person beta:
you can find it in most restaurants, but the best place is certainly quanjude restaurant.

person alpha:
is it near here?

person beta:
not too near but not too far either. a taxi will take you there in 15 minutes, if the traffic is not too bad, i mean.

person alpha:
well, thank you for your information. but what is the name of that restaurant again?

person beta:
let me write it down on this slip of paper for you. you can show it to the taxi-driver.

person alpha:
that's very kind of you. thanks a lot.

person beta:
hi, isaiah. how are you?

person alpha:
i'm well. and you?

person beta:
fine. how's your job going?

person alpha:
i don't know if i told you or not, but i decided to start my own business.

person beta:
really? that's fantastic. what kind of business is it?

person alpha:
i've started an investment banking firm with some of my old colleagues from goldman sachs.

person beta:
how's it going?

person alpha:
it started off a bit slow, but now, business is really booming!

person beta:
that's such great news. i'm really happy for you! where is your office located?

person alpha:
our headoffice is here in beijing, but we're planning on opening up two more offices soon.

person beta:
where will those be located?

person alpha:
if all goes well, we'll open one up in hong kong in april and another one in singapore in october.

person beta:
when will you find out?

person alpha:
we're negotiating the final details of the leasing contracts tomorrow.

person beta:
well, good luck. i hope it all goes well for you tomorrow!

person alpha:
thanks!

person beta:
ant shirley, it's being years since we last met. how were you doing in the passing years?

person alpha:
pretty well. what about you?

person beta:
fine. where are the other guys?

person alpha:
it's a bit disappointing that they are all out for a movie.

person beta:
bad timing. i want to see them so much. how are they?

person alpha:
not bad. i heard you are going to graduate this coming summer, right?

person beta:
yes, that's why i'm here. i'm thinking about buying a second-hand apartment.

person alpha:
did you go to a real estate agent?

person beta:
no, that will be too expensive.

person alpha:
that's true. by the way, what kind of apartment are you looking for?

person beta:
my first job's salary will be a bit low. so the cheaper the better. just one i can afford.

person alpha:
sure. i'll try my best to find a satisfying one for you.

person beta:
i'll appreciate it so much.

person alpha:
good afternoon.

person beta:
my goodness! it's the afternoon? doesn't the time fly! do come in and sit down.

person alpha:
thank you.

person beta:
what's the time? my watch has stopped.

person alpha:
it's half past twelve.

person beta:
when do you have lunch?

person alpha:
from one to two.

person beta:
what do you normally eat?

person alpha:
we usually go to the cafeteria.

person beta:
oh, it's time to have lunch now.

person alpha:
let's go together.

person beta:
merry christmas, bill.

person alpha:
merry christmas, jina.

person beta:
what are you doing there on the computer?

person alpha:
come have a look, i received many beautiful e-cards. they are from my friends, all over the world. christmas wishes for all my friends.

person beta:
that's pretty interesting. did you get one from haven? the reason i ask is that i am looking for her number.

person alpha:
sorry, i don't have it. but i do have her email. you want me to sent it to you?

person beta:
yeah, that would be great. thanks.

person alpha:
no worries. i just for her card. and you can get her from email. i would really like to talk to her again. i kind of miss her a little this days.

person beta:
thanks million.

person alpha:
my pleasure.

person beta:
there are so many eating utensils on the table. which ones do i use first?

person alpha:
use them from the outside in.

person beta:
i see. a set for appetizers and another for the main course.

person alpha:
right. we do the same thing at home. don't you remember?

person beta:
oh yeah. the big napkin goes on my lap.

person alpha:
let's look at our menus.

person beta:
cindy, help me order because i'm still not very familiar with american cooking.

person alpha:
well, we order appetizers first and then entrees.

person beta:
it was nice talking to you.

person alpha:
why are you trying to rush me off the phone?

person beta:
i really have to go.

person alpha:
why? i still wanted to talk to you.

person beta:
i have things to do.

person alpha:
like what?

person beta:
don't be nosey.

person alpha:
i'm not. i just want to know.

person beta:
well, it's really none of your business.

person alpha:
that's harsh.

person beta:
i'm sorry, but i have to go.

person alpha:
fine.

person beta:
mom, will you have time to help me with my homework today?

person alpha:
sorry, i won't. i'll be working against the clock to finish my presentation.

person beta:
well, peter, you have to do better than that next time, won't you?

person alpha:
have i really got to do those exams again, dad?

person beta:
of course, you have. you must try harder this time.

person alpha:
and must i go back to school?

person beta:
no, you needn't do that. you'd better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes.

person alpha:
but dad, i should be working full-time at my age. i'm nearly 17.

person beta:
you ought to have worked harder then you wouldn't have failed your exams. you have to take a job and study.

person alpha:
what else i've got to do? join the army?

person beta:
who knows! that might come to later.

person alpha:
how do you do?

person beta:
my name is wang liang, i'm from beijing. where do you come from?

person alpha:
i come from the city of tangshan in hebes province.

person beta:
you're from tangshan? i can't believe my ears. i was also born in tangshan, but i was brought up in beijing.

person alpha:
really? it's nice to meet you. how long have you been with this company?

person beta:
just over 4 years now. since this is your first day here, i'm sure you don't really know too much yet. let me show you around, so you can introduce yourself to everyone.

person alpha:
oh, thank you very much!

person beta:
hello, parker. how's everything?

person alpha:
can't complain. and you?

person beta:
business is booming. i understand you want to meet up with me next week. how's your schedule look?

person alpha:
let me see. i can come out and see you first thing wednesday.

person beta:
great.

person alpha:
i like to open up a savings account please.

person beta:
o. k. we offer a few different kinds.

person alpha:
i want the one with the highest interest rate.

person beta:
that would be our saver's plus account.

person alpha:
4.5%, that's good. how much money do i have to keep in it to get that rate?

person beta:
you have to maintain a balance of$ 10,000 in the account or the rate drops to 3%.

person alpha:
all right. i'll open one of those.

person beta:
just fill out these forms, and i'll be with you in one second.

person alpha:
thanks.

person beta:
hi, where can i find a cheap cashmere sweater?

person alpha:
how about an outlet?

person beta:
great idea!

person alpha:
outlets give good deals.

person beta:
thank you so much.

person alpha:
you're welcome.

person beta:
i have difficulty with this form. will you please explain it to me?

person alpha:
actually there is a sample over there. but if you still have a problem, let me know.

person beta:
oh, that's great. thank you very much.

person alpha:
do you develop films here?

person beta:
yes, we shall. what size do you like?

person alpha:
well, the 4 x 6 is fine.

person beta:
which do you prefer, color or black and white?

person alpha:
the last one is black and white, all the rest should need color.

person beta:
ok.

person alpha:
i hope they will come out well. when should i pick them up?

person beta:
they will be ready at noon tomorrow. each negative develops one print, right?

person alpha:
yes, it is. and develop them as glossy as possible.

person beta:
no problem. do you need another film?

person alpha:
yes, a roll of kodak film please.

person beta:
it is totally$ 20 including the deposit for films.

person alpha:
how come it is slow as a snail today?

person beta:
you mean the network connection?

person alpha:
yes, i wanted to look for some information on the company page just now. it took me almost one minute to open it. then there is no response for any click.

person beta:
i have the same question. i can't send out mails. we'd better call the it department and ask them to check it immediately.

person alpha:
ok.

person beta:
i need help. i think my arm is broken.

person alpha:
alright. have you been to this hospital before?

person beta:
no, i haven't. i need help quick. it hurts really badly.

person alpha:
i understand. it's good you came to the emergency room.

person beta:
let me see a doctor.

person alpha:
i'm sorry, sir. you will need to wait at least a short time.we are very busy tonight. there was a big car accident on highway 106.

person beta:
i thought this was the emergency room.

person alpha:
it is. but unless you are critically injured, you still need to wait.you aren't bleeding, are you?

person beta:
no. only a little. i fell off my porch.

person alpha:
oh, that's terrible. is it your right arm or your left arm?

person beta:
my left arm.

person alpha:
can you fill out this form then?

person beta:
no, i can't. i'm left-handed.

person alpha:
that's very inconvenient for you then.you'll probably have a cast on your left arm.

person beta:
yes. but why do i have to fill out a form anyway? this is the emergency room.

person alpha:
yes, it is. but even in emergency rooms there is some paperwork to be done.have you ever been in an emergency room before?

person beta:
no. just let me see a doctor. i'm worried about my arm.

person alpha:
be brave, sir. it won't be long. i will fill out the form for you. what is your name?

person beta:
steve schliessman. s c h l i e s s m a n.

person alpha:
alright steve. your social security number?

person beta:
349-95- 8821.

person alpha:
do you have medical insurance?

person beta:
yes, i do. blue cross.

person alpha:
do you have your insurance card with you?

person beta:
no, i don't.

person alpha:
well, you can call it in later. you can phone us.

person beta:
can i sit down now?

person alpha:
first i need to get your address. try to move your arm as little as possible.

person beta:
hi! is that the new laptop you brought last week? it looks very nice.

person alpha:
yes, it is. thanks. i'm just surfing on the internet.

person beta:
here? in this cafe? how can you do that?

person alpha:
this cafe offers a wireless internet connection. that means i can get on the net for free while i'm here. of course, i have to buy a cup of coffee!

person beta:
that's great. can you do it anywhere?

person alpha:
no. you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection. there are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city.

person beta:
so, what programs do you have on your laptop?

person alpha:
i've got all the usual ones for word processing and then i have a few for creating and editing photographs.

person beta:
i know you are keen on photography. it's very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera. then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone, anywhere, at a

person alpha:
it's wonderful, isn't it? would you like to see some photos that i took recently?

person beta:
what shall we do today?

person alpha:
we'd better stay in the hotel, because the tour will begin tomorrow.

person beta:
let's go out for some exercise, shall we?

person alpha:
what an excellent idea!

person beta:
shall we do some jogging?

person alpha:
ok.

person beta:
i feel well now.

person alpha:
yes, some exercise is necessary for us.

person beta:
quite right.

person alpha:
i was wondering if you need any help on your new project.

person beta:
sure! that would be great! are you good at writing or would you rather do the computer work?

person alpha:
i would like to help with the computer work.

person beta:
great! we are going to be working in teams of three. are you ok working with others?

person alpha:
yes, i like working like that.

person beta:
we will begin next monday. would you be available then?

person alpha:
yes, i can be there.

person beta:
well, if you could send me your basic background information before next monday, it would be useful.

person alpha:
ok, i will send the information to you.

person beta:
well then, thanks for your help. have a great day!

person alpha:
congratulations, francis. your hard working finally pays off. i am so happy for your promotion.

person beta:
thanks, monica. without support from you and other colleagues, i would not have made it.

person alpha:
i hope i could get promoted some day. tell me about your experience, ok?

person beta:
well, just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough, you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective. don't be afraid of taking challenging. they might be opportunities and failing is not fatal. you learn more from that actually. sometimes, you need to fail to be successful.

person alpha:
how do you think if i volunteer for some work?

person beta:
i think it is a smart idea. our boss always likes it when employees take initiatives.

person alpha:
taxi!

person beta:
yes, sir. where to?

person alpha:
the city square, please.

person beta:
are you in a hurry?

person alpha:
yes, i have to be there to meet a friend at 5 thirty pm. so we're sure we can get there on time?

person beta:
i'm afraid not, sir. generally we can, but you know how it is in the rush hour now.

person alpha:
i see. here's the extra 5$ for you if you can get me there on time.

person beta:
all right. i'll do my best.

person alpha:
oh.we made it. thank you. how much do i own you?

person beta:
the reading on the kilometer is 12$.

person alpha:
here's the money, keep the changes, please.

person beta:
do you need a receipt?

person alpha:
no, thank you.

person beta:
janice, i can't find the document i was working on last month. can you help me to look for it?

person alpha:
susan, i'm sorry. did you look up those files i requested?

person beta:
yes, but i still can not find it. maybe it is in this cabinet.

person alpha:
i couldn't find the files you request, even though i checked all the cross-references. i don't think it's there.

person beta:
i am sure that document was filed.

person alpha:
well, let me check again under a different heading.

person beta:
good idea! it seems that i asked you to put it in nova's files.

person alpha:
maybe that's why i couldn't find it. all the documents on nova are filed under'v'.

person beta:
what would you have?

person alpha:
i'll try chinese wine.

person beta:
what about this dry red? it's good indeed, it never goes to the head.

person alpha:
ok. give me one, please.

person beta:
here it is.

person alpha:
thank you.

person beta:
i'm always at your service.

person alpha:
are you planning on voting?

person beta:
yes. are you?

person alpha:
i will be voting tomorrow.

person beta:
what's your polling place?

person alpha:
my polling place is at the park up the street.

person beta:
oh, yeah?

person alpha:
yeah, where is yours?

person beta:
i don't know.

person alpha:
how is it you don't know?

person beta:
the location of my polling place never came in the mail.

person alpha:
you can always just check online.

person beta:
let me go do that.

person alpha:
i am sorry, i have broken my wine glass, and would you please bring me another?

person beta:
sure. i will clean the glasses for you.

person alpha:
thank you. where is the washing room?

person beta:
walk straight and turn left.

person alpha:
what's wrong, officer?

person beta:
you do realize that you ran a red light, don't you?

person alpha:
i did?

person beta:
you didn't see the red light?

person alpha:
i'm sorry for running it, but i really didn't know.

person beta:
didn't you learn that red means stop?

person alpha:
i know that.

person beta:
then tell me why you sped up on the yellow light.

person alpha:
i'm not sure.

person beta:
i'm giving you a ticket for this.

person alpha:
i'm sorry for the misunderstanding.

person beta:
maybe you'll think about this before you decide to run another light.

person alpha:
medicine industry, this is peter bush speaking, can i help you?

person beta:
good afternoon, could you connect this call with mr brown, please

person alpha:
may i know who's calling?

person beta:
this is li ping of abc computer company limited. i'm calling on our mr wilson the general manager of our company.

person alpha:
i'm sorry, mrs li, mr brown is now in a meeting.may i have your number, and ask him to call you back later?

person beta:
i'm afraid mr wilson would like to speak to mr brown right now.he's got an urgent matter to discuss with mr brown without delay.

person alpha:
ok, then would you please hold the line? mr li, the line is through, mr brown is ready answering the call, go ahead.

person beta:
thank you for your assistance, mr bush.

person alpha:
you are welcome.

person beta:
mr. li, i come to remind you of the meeting scheduled at 11 o'clock this morning.

person alpha:
oh, that's right. and the general manager asked me to report the company's sales for last year at the meeting.

person beta:
by the way, the meeting will be held in your office.

person alpha:
ok, thank you very much.

person beta:
not at all. that's what i should do.

person alpha:
bob, would you come and help me?

person beta:
of course. what do you want me to do, mom?

person alpha:
could you hold these packages while i look for the key?

person beta:
alright, what's in them? they are so heavy!

person alpha:
just things we need for the picnic tomorrow.

person beta:
well, hurry up and open the door please. i told you these things are heavy.

person alpha:
i'm sorry, but i just can't find the key. you must have it.

person beta:
oh, yes, it's in my pocket. but how can i get the key while i'm holding all these bags?

person alpha:
excuse me. my name is dan ford. i have an appointment with the dentist at 3:30.

person beta:
yes, mr. ford. the dentist will be ready to see you in a minute. have a seat.

person alpha:
thank you.

person beta:
isn't it past your bedtime already?

person alpha:
i am not sleepy.

person beta:
it's getting late, and you have to wake up early tomorrow.

person alpha:
there is no way that i can fall asleep right now.

person beta:
try listening to some soft music.

person alpha:
it won't work. i'm nowhere close to being tired.

person beta:
i really don't care, just go to sleep.

person alpha:
what if i stay up and do something, until i get tired?

person beta:
you'll be up all night if i let you do that.

person alpha:
i'm going to get to sleep eventually.

person beta:
you need to go to sleep now, so go to sleep.

person alpha:
good night.

person beta:
i want to go try on these clothes.

person alpha:
what did you find?

person beta:
i found some jeans, and a new blouse.

person alpha:
go and try it on.

person beta:
what do you think?

person alpha:
i love that shirt on you.

person beta:
what about the jeans?

person alpha:
they don't really fit you right.

person beta:
i don't think so either.

person alpha:
that blouse is absolutely wonderful on you though.

person beta:
well, i'll just buy the shirt.

person alpha:
that would be a good idea.

person beta:
now, miss childs passed on your resume to me and i've had the chance to look it over and i must say i'm quite impressed.

person alpha:
thank you very much. i've tried to keep it short and clear. if there's any questions please feel free to ask me.

person beta:
well yes, i do have a number of questions, but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview i'd like to get a little bit of an idea of your background.

person alpha:
yes, of course. well as you can see from the resume i'm 27 and grew up in brooklyn, new york, although our family moved to london when i was quite young, at around sixteen.

person beta:
ah i see, so you were actually educated in europe?

person alpha:
yes precisely. although i was born in the us, i would definitely call london home. but as you see i've actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country. my father was in the oil business before he retired so we also spent a number of years in saudi arabia too.

person beta:
very interesting. so it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood.

person alpha:
absolutely! we were never still for too long. but now i'm really looking to settle down.

person beta:
i see. okay, well let's move on to discuss your education shall we?

person alpha:
can you tell me, ms. smith, about the training programs you initiated this year?

person beta:
we ran a call center training service and language program to ensure that our customer service representatives are well trained.

person alpha:
what's the result?

person beta:
we directly attribute an increase in our customer service feedback of 50% to the increase in language skills and training that our employees have received.

person alpha:
that seems very impressive. good work!

person beta:
thank you, but i cannot take all the credit. our employees have all worked very hard to increase their productivity level.

person alpha:
well, good morning, tom. i haven't seen you for a long time.

person beta:
i'd been feeling pretty well until just a few days ago.

person alpha:
what seems to be the trouble now?

person beta:
i feel run down, tired. i've been having headaches almost every day. and i'm not getting as much sleep as usually do.

person alpha:
have you been eating properly? eating the right kind of food is important for your health, you know.

person beta:
well, i haven't been eating well, i guess. i usually only have enough time to grab a sandwich and a cup of coffee for lunch.

person alpha:
and what about dinner?

person beta:
sometimes i'm too tired to eat anything at all.

person alpha:
that's not good. you don't have a well-balanced diet. have you been taking vitamin pills?

person beta:

we're going to the bookshop. would you like to join us?

yes, i would. i need to buy a textbook for my course and, as you know, i love browsing through the latest paperbacks.

person alpha:

person beta:
i want to look at nelson mandela's autobiography.

person alpha:
this is sure to be a worthwhile read.

person beta:
doctor, i have the worst toothache!

person alpha:
how long have you had this pain?

person beta:
for about a week or so, but it's gotten really bad in the last couple of days.

person alpha:
did you do anything that might have aggravated your tooth?

person beta:
you know, i was eating jawbreakers in the movies the other day, and i accidentally bit down really hard on one.

person alpha:
what kind of toothbrush do you use?

person beta:
i just use a regular hard bristle toothbrush.

person alpha:
does it bother you when you eat something really cold?

person beta:
yes, it definitely bothers me more when i do that.

person alpha:
good evening.

person beta:
good evening.my wife and i would like a room, please.is there any room available? we don't have a reservation.

person alpha:
let me see.yes, we have one room left.you're lucky.it's the last one.

person beta:
good.we're tired after driving all day, and we're looking forward to relaxing in a comfortable room.

person alpha:
this room has two double beds.it's number 56 at the rear of the motel.it's quite a comfortable room.

person beta:
how much is it for one night? we only need it for tonight.we're going to continue our trip in the morning.

person alpha:
it's forty-five dollars a night for two.is anyone else traveling with you?

person beta:
no, it's just the two of us.

person alpha:
would you like to pay for the room in cash or with a credit card?

person beta:

please fill out this registration card.here is your key.you can park your car in front of our room.check- out time is noon.

person beta:
thank you very much.

person alpha:
thank you, sir.enjoy your stay with us.

person beta:
let's go to the animal shelter.

person alpha:
what do you want to do?

person beta:
i want to get a puppy for my son.

person alpha:
that will make him so happy.

person beta:
i'll get him one of those little dogs.

person alpha:
one that won't grow up too big.

person beta:
and eat too much.

person alpha:
do you know which one he would like?

person beta:
oh, yes, i took him there yesterday. he showed me one that he really liked.

person alpha:
i bet you had to drag him away.

person beta:
he wanted to take it home yesterday.

person alpha:
i wonder what he'll name it.

person beta:
hello. i want to send the computer to my sister in shanghai by logistics transport.

person alpha:
ok. is it in the box? may i see it?

person beta:
yes. this is the computer and this is the keyboard and the monitor.

person alpha:
is there anything else?

person beta:
there are a mouse and a camera.

person alpha:
is that all?

person beta:
yes. how much is it to send these things to shanghai by regular delivery?

person alpha:
it depends on the weight of these things. generally speaking, we will charge you ten yuan for one kilogram.

person beta:
i see. can you weigh them for me, please?

person alpha:
please go over there to weigh them.

person beta:
ok. see you later.

person alpha:
what happened? why didn't he win?

person beta:
didn't you hear? he was disqualified.

person alpha:
how did that happen? he's so talented! i thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal!

person beta:
if he didn't have any drug problems, he would have won.

person alpha:
what? what kind of drugs was he using?

person beta:
he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster.

person alpha:
i thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs.

person beta:
they are. the reason why they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards.

person alpha:
that's so disappointing. i don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs.

person beta:
i don't think it's right, but i can understand why they might. imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country!

person alpha:
regardless of how much pressure you're under, there's never a good reason to take drugs.

person beta:
i agree. hopefully with the new regulations, fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs.

person alpha:
let's hope so.

person beta:
i need to use the atm.

person alpha:
what's stopping you?

person beta:
i'm not sure how.

person alpha:
i don't understand.

person beta:
i've never used one before.

person alpha:
i can help you figure it out.

person beta:
what do i have to do?

person alpha:
slide your card into the machine.

person beta:
then what?

person alpha:
you need to type your pin in.

person beta:
what do i have to do next?

person alpha:
click on whichever option you want, and you're done.

person beta:
what are you doing? checking the" to do" list for the wedding?

person alpha:
yep. there's still so much to do!

person beta:
so let's start by checking off what we've already done.

person alpha:
did you reconfirm the plane reservations for all the taiwanese guests?

person beta:
not yet, i was busy getting that videographer who films stuff for the net.

person alpha:
cool! i can't believe he agreed to go all the way to dallas with us!

person beta:
hey! we're paying for his ticket!

person alpha:
it is my first time coming to china. i want to buy something unique of china to my friends as gifts.

person beta:
we have a great variety of chinese antiques and porcelain. do you like them?

person alpha:
yes, i love them, but they are fragile. it is not convenient to take them.

person beta:
you are right. how about paintings and embroidered handkerchiefs?

person alpha:
sounds good. may i have a look?

person beta:
of course. these paintings have many designs, such as animals, flowers, landscape, aquatics and so on.

person alpha:
they are beautiful, but i can't understand the connotation in them. let me see the handkerchiefs.

person beta:
all right. chinese embroidery is one traditional art with elaborate design and high quality.

person alpha:
oh, i like the bamboo design. what is this?

person beta:
this is a series of animals, called chinese zodiac.

person alpha:
good. so i will take three series and five bamboo ones.

person beta:
ok, i will wrap them for you.

person alpha:
can you make out what he's saying?

person beta:
no, it's too loud in here.

person alpha:
excuse me.

person beta:
yes?

person alpha:
can you tell me the way to the peak tram, please?

person beta:
certainly. go along queen's road...

person alpha:
along queen's road...

person beta:
yes, and turn right at the hilton hotel.

person alpha:
right at the hilton.

person beta:
then go up garden road, past the cathedral.

person alpha:
the cathedral?

person beta:
yes. then cross the road at the next traffic lights. the peak tram is straight ahead. you can't miss it.

person alpha:
that's very kind of you. thank you. er... have you got a pencil?

person beta:
yes. why?

person alpha:
can you repeat all that? i think i'd better write it down.

person beta:
hi, nally, are you hungry?

person alpha:
i'm starving. let's go grab a bite.

person beta:
where to?

person alpha:
how about karlis?

person beta:
are you kidding? that place is too ritzy for lunch.

person alpha:
true. ok let's go to grumose?

person beta:
same thing, meals there all coarsen arm and leg.

person alpha:
i guess it is a little pricy.

person beta:
let's stop it at multicolor for a quick lunch..

person alpha:
that will be ok. come on, i can't wait to chow down.

person beta:
that was a great lunch, the food was good, but the service was lousy.

person alpha:
is that why you stiffed the waiter?

person beta:
you got it. all right, let's go back to school.

person alpha:
good morning, sir.

person beta:
good morning. i'd like a business suit made with this material.

person alpha:
do you have a particular style in mind?

person beta:
the kind that never goes out of fashion, i guess.

person alpha:
i think you should realize that even the most conservative style changes.

person beta:
i'm sure you're right. i just dread the idea of making a new suit every year.

person alpha:
the changes are usually not that dramatic. we just got some pictures of the latest fashion. would you like to take a look?

person beta:
good. i think i'll choose this single breasted one. when can i get it?

person alpha:
next friday.

person beta:
thank you.

person alpha:
oh, gosh! i feel everything around me is against me.

person beta:
don't take it too hard. there are some tips you should know in job-hunting of 2010.

person alpha:
well, i am all ears. maybe they are helpful.

person beta:
firstly, you must always show your best to the interviewer. and secondly, try to avoid spamming through e-mails, because this will make the reader go crazy. the last but not the least, there is no substitute for pounding the pavement in such a digital age.

person alpha:
i understand what you mean, and i will not upset myself. face it.

person beta:
good luck to us.

person alpha:
look, mary! there are so many people over there!

person beta:
oh, i remember, there is a job fair in the personnel market.

person alpha:
i have never been to the personnel market.

person beta:
really? i have been there several times.

person alpha:
are there many employers?

person beta:
yes. the personnel market is a place specially for job-hunters and employers.

person alpha:
so there will be many large companies in the personnel market, right?

person beta:
yes, there are many famous corporations.

person alpha:
when will there be a job fair?

person beta:
every saturday and sunday

person alpha:
do i need to pay to go into the personnel market?

person beta:
no, it's free.

person alpha:
how about going there to have a look now?

person beta:
ok, let's go.

person alpha:
could you show me the t-shirt on the model?

person beta:
here you are. we have three different colors, white, blue and pink.

person alpha:
what's the price?

person beta:
$ 12.

person alpha:
can you make it any cheaper?

person beta:
it is cheap.

person alpha:
i'll take it if you give me a discount.

person beta:
$ 10. that's the best i can do.

person alpha:
ok. i'll take the blue one.

person beta:
hello, again. did you discuss everything with your colleagues?

person alpha:
yes, yes. it seems that everything is settled.

person beta:
have you decided how you would like the salaries paid?

person alpha:
we have discussed it and decided that at the moment we would like the salaries to be paid into the employees's accounts, whether they are currently with this bank or not.

person beta:
that's not a problem.

person alpha:
of course, if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank, or open new accounts with you.

person beta:
thank you very much. we always welcome new customers.

person alpha:
i think this spring is a good time for us to start looking.

person beta:
we should plan to move out of here before july. i'm tired of living in apartments.

person alpha:
i know, dear. i am too. but we've just been too busy to look for a house.

person beta:
we need to find a good realtor.

person alpha:
not necessarily. if we use a realtor to find a house, it will be more expensive.

person beta:
what do you mean?

person alpha:
realtors always get a commission.if the realtor helps us find something, we have to pay him.

person beta:
but doesn't a realtor help with the contract? i thought they take care of all the legal troubles.

person alpha:
yes, that's often true. but you have to pay them.

person beta:
i still think we should have a realtor.we're new in this country. we don't know all the laws of buying a house.and also, the realtor will inspect the house.he can tell us if the house has

person alpha:
of course we need a home inspector.but we can hire an inspector on our own.and as for the legal problems, i have friends. they can help us.

person beta:
so how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor?

person alpha:
it takes a little more time. we have to check the ads in the paper.probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads.then we have to drive to the homes and look at them.

person beta:
and doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor?

person alpha:
sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. it's best to find someone who is selling by themselves.

person beta:
why?

person alpha:
because if the seller has a realtor, their price will be higher.he will have to pay a commission to the realtor.

person beta:
hmm. it all sounds very complicated.

person alpha:
it is. but buying a house is very important. so it takes time.that's why we haven't done it yet. it's very troublesome.

person beta:
i want to look in the papers today. maybe we can see something we like.

person alpha:
alright. i'll buy a newspaper when i go to the drug store.

person beta:
i'm calling about our appointment. i can't call on you this evening.my wife is terribly ill.

person alpha:
sorry to hear that.

person beta:
how about next week?

person alpha:
fine, we'll be expecting you then.

person beta:
which restaurant do you prefer?

person alpha:
i'd like to taste mexican food.

person beta:
how about the one on baker street?

person alpha:
oh, i've never seen a better mexican restaurant.

person beta:
the numbers in this table don't seem to be in accord with reality.

person alpha:
i know, but these are the figures that we came up with.

person beta:
oh, so the zoo is over there. thank you so much for your help.

person alpha:
you're welcome. can i ask you what brings you to china?

person beta:
i'm actually travelling around asia.

person alpha:
oh, very nice. how long will you be in beijing?

person beta:
probably another week.

person alpha:
oh, i see. well, i'll give you my phone number and if you need a guide, please call me.

person beta:
thank you very much. that's very kind.

person alpha:
could you type up this document for me, sandra?

person beta:
sure, but i have to finish this report first.

person alpha:
never mind. i'll do it.

person beta:
are you interested in mountaineering?

person alpha:
yes, in some sense. i should say i like mountain climbing, you know, because i'm not so professional. how about you

person beta:
i'm the same with you, an amateur mountain climber. i went climbing in the rocky mountains with my friends last summer vacation. we spent two days in the mountains.

person alpha:
how did you spend the night there?

person beta:
we pitched a tent in the night, waiting for the sunrise. wow! it was too beautiful.

person alpha:
i had a similar experience, but that was on the top of tasha mountain in my country.

person beta:
tasha mountain? it's very famous in china, isn't?

person alpha:
yes. it is one of the five mountains.

person beta:
i want to climb tasha mountain this summer vacation. would you be my guide?

person alpha:
i'd love to.

person beta:
sir, what's wrong with you?

person alpha:
i have a spasm of nausea and dizziness.

person beta:
have you ever suffered from airsickness before? you're probably airsick.

person alpha:
no, this is the first time on a plane. maybe you are right.. please get me some pills.

person beta:
ok. i will get some for you. there's an airsickness bag behind the seat in front of you.please wait me for a moment.( go away for a few minutes, and now she comes back.) here are two pills. and the water is in the glass too.please take the pills with water.

person alpha:
thank you very much.( take the pills.)

person beta:
are you feeling better now?

person alpha:
much better now. thanks again.

person beta:
my pleasure.

person alpha:
hi bill, it's jane.

person beta:
jane, i'm on the other line, can you hang on for a second?

person alpha:
sure.

person beta:
ok, i'll be right back.

person alpha:
have you decided what you'd like?

person beta:
yes. first i'll have tomato juice.

person alpha:
and then?

person beta:
i'll have the lamb chops, well-done, please.

person alpha:
good morning, madam. what can i do for you?

person beta:
can you show me some traditional chinese arts and crafts?

person alpha:
maybe sandalwood fan is good.

person beta:
would you show me some?

person alpha:
of course.

person beta:
they really smell fragrant. how much is a real sandalwood fan?

person alpha:
the small ones are one hundred yuan for each. and the big ones are two hundred and thirty yuan.

person beta:
i'll take two small ones and a big one.

person alpha:
what else are you interested in?

person beta:
i'm afraid not.

person alpha:
ok. here you are.

person beta:
good morning.mrs.smith.

person alpha:
good morning! can you help me, please? i'm looking for some books for my mother.

person beta:
well, what kind of books does she like?

person alpha:
she's very fond of detective stories?

person beta:
i see.has she read any detective stories?

person alpha:
oh, yes!

person beta:
do you know if she's read this one?

person alpha:
i'm not sure, but she probably won't remember if she has! she's very forgetful!

person beta:
ah! she has a bad memory.how old is she?

person alpha:
she's eighty-seven.

person beta:
i suggest you take this book.it's very exciting.

person alpha:
thank you.that's a good idea.she likes exciting books.can you suggest another one?

person beta:
hey, jimmy, you've been sitting in front of the tv all day. anything interesting on tv?

person alpha:
not really. quite boring right now, actually. mostly infomercials and public service announcements.

person beta:
why don't you turn off the tv and get outside? you need to get some fresh air.

person alpha:
i know, i know.but my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes. it's the series finals, and i wouldn't miss it for the world!

person beta:
really? what's the series about?

person alpha:
well, it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in america. it's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny. i think you'd like it.

person beta:
it sounds interesting, but i am not a big fan of tv shows. they're time consuming and don't have much depth.

person alpha:
i believe some shows are quite informative and interesting. take this show for example, it examines american xenophobia and how it might conflict with the american dream, with hilarious results.

person beta:
really? that's interesting!

person alpha:
yeah.oh, here it comes! why don't we watch it together? they are going to have a court debate in this episode. it should be good.

person beta:
ok, i'll give it a go.

person alpha:
hello, hot water overflowed from the bathtub. would you help me?

person beta:
would you turn off the tap?

person alpha:
i did it.

person beta:
then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door.

person alpha:
ok, i will.

person beta:
i will have our housekeeper come right away.

person alpha:
i am sorry, i was too tired to fall asleep.

person beta:
when you woke up, the water was coming out the tub?

person alpha:
right. can i compensate for the damage with the travel accident insurance?

person beta:
hi. i'm looking for a gift for my niece.

person alpha:
well, little girls seem to love barbie dolls.

person beta:
that's perfect. i want to see one.

person alpha:
here you are-- she's called digital barbie.

person beta:
oh, i like digital barbie! how much does she cost?

person alpha:
this barbie is only$ 29.95.

person beta:
that's perfect. let me have her.

person alpha:
very good. is there anything else you would like?

person beta:
no, that'll do it for now.

person alpha:
including tax, your total will be$ 32.42. cash or charge?

person beta:
let me give you cash, please.

person alpha:
here's your change and receipt. thank you.

person beta:
please put your baggage on the counter and open it, let me have a look.

person alpha:
yes, sir. please examine it.

person beta:
anything subject to duty in your suitcase?

person alpha:
no, sir. nothing except my personal belongings, such as clothes, notebooks and some gifts.

person beta:
any cigarettes or liquor?

person alpha:
i have cigarettes for my own use.

person beta:
i think you'll have to pay some duty on these cigarettes because they exceed the quota. and this article is liable for duty.

person alpha:
how much duty should i pay?

person beta:
one hundred dollars.

person alpha:
here is the money.

person beta:
just a moment. i'll make out your duty memo.( writing and giving the memo to mr. green) take it and pay the girl over there.

person alpha:
thank you.

person beta:
so that concludes the introduction. now let's move to the first part of my talk, which is about 2006 fiscal year marketing plan. so first, right off the bat, when looking at the marketing plan, tell me some of the goals that we had set this year to begin with...

person alpha:
we wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also, in line with that goal, redo our image...

person beta:
that's correct. if you remember, we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets. now, when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals, there are three things to consider. first, the original condition of the market, second, our marketing numbers from the previous year, and third, our final sales figures for this year. now i want to describe for you the second and third parts. if you look at the overhead, you'll see a graph... the blue line represents our sales from the year 2005, the red line is the sales in 2006... as you can see, our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with, but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year. on the other hand, you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket.

person alpha:
excuse me, sir, may i talk to you?

person beta:
bill! sure, come on in. what can i do for you?

person alpha:
well sir, as you know, i have been an employee of this prestigious firm for over ten years.

person beta:
yes.

person alpha:
i won't beat around the bush. sir, i would like a raise. i currently have three companies after me and so i decided to talk to you first.

person beta:
a raise? son, i would love to give you a raise, but this is just not the right time.

person alpha:
i understand your position, and i know that the current economic downturn has had a negative impact on sales, but you must also take into consideration my hard work, pro-activeness and loyalty to this company for over a decade.

person beta:
taking into account these factors, and considering i don't want to start a brain drain, i'm willing to offer you a ten percent raise and an extra five days of vacation time. how does that sound?

person alpha:
great! it's a deal! thank you, sir!

person beta:
before you go, just out of curiosity, what companies were after you?

person alpha:
oh, the electric company, gas company and water company!

person beta:
are you going to vote on tuesday?

person alpha:
of course. how about you?

person beta:
i've already voted.

person alpha:
how's that?

person beta:
i sent in an absentee ballot.

person alpha:
why?

person beta:
i won't be able to vote on tuesday.

person alpha:
why not?

person beta:
i have to work.

person alpha:
why don't you go to work late?

person beta:
i have important business to take care of that morning.

person alpha:
i see.

person beta:
how would you describe your ideal job?

person alpha:
i think the job should make use of the professional experience i have obtained, and offer me opportunity for advancement.

person beta:
why do you think you might like to work for our company?

person alpha:
i feel my background and experience are a good fit for this position and i am very interested.what's more, your company is outstanding in this field.

person beta:
what makes you think you would be a success in this position?

person alpha:
my graduate school training combined with my experience as an intern should qualify me for this particular job. i am sure i will be successful.

person beta:
how do you know about this company?

person alpha:
your company is very reputed in this city. i heard much praise to your company.

person beta:
did you see the picture of the guy on the front page of the newspaper this morning?

person alpha:
no. i haven't had a chance to read the paper yet.

person beta:
you've got to see it. it's an unbelievable picture!

person alpha:
what's so interesting about it?

person beta:
well, this guy fell asleep on the sofa and when he woke up, half his face had been bitten off!

person alpha:
what? how did that happen?

person beta:
they think his dog was trying to wake him up and couldn't, so ended up biting him in his face.

person alpha:

he was actually quite handsome. what a shame.

person alpha:
what's he going to do now?

person alpha:
do you mind i have a look at your computer?

person beta:

person alpha:

i'm afraid i can't because i'm a stranger here.

we are interested in some precision machine tools. we have some inquires on hand.

person alpha:
can i have a look at your catalogue and the corresponding technical data?

person beta:
why, of course. here are some that will show you our latest development. you may select which ever you need.

person alpha:
i think our users have the impression that your prices are always much too high, compared with those of other supplies.

person beta:
excuse me. it's true that our products do cost slightly more than the other makers, but it's only due to our technological superiority.

person alpha:
your products may have certain advantages, but your prices are too stiff.

person beta:
if you give us your inquiry, i shall go very carefully into the price and try my best to put you on the best of the terms.

person alpha:
ok, i'll come back to discuss it to some details after our users have studied your catalogues and price list.

person beta:
yes, surely. we hope to do some substantial business with you.

person alpha:
can i take your order now, madam?

person beta:
yes, what would you recommend?

person alpha:
i'm happy to recommend the fish, it testes delicious, and it is today's special. our chef is from the coast, and love seafood. today special is actually his favorite dish. so i'm sure it is a

person beta:
it does sound wonderful, maybe i'll try it.

person alpha:
is there anything else? maybe i can interest you in one of fine appetizers, such as the escargot.

person beta:
not today, thanks. but i'd like to know any of the vegetarian dishes.

person alpha:
yes, here's the menu. what would you think of your order.

person beta:
maybe i don't want the fish, i think i had the greenbean dish instead.

person alpha:
what kind of soup would you like?

person beta:
i'd like the egg drop soup.

person alpha:
ok, is that all?

person beta:
yes.

person alpha:
what would you like anything to drink or you wait?

person beta:
just nice water, thanks.

person alpha:
look, here is a very special business card from an illustrator. every time i go through my book of business cards, i will notice it. it is an eye-catching one.

person beta:
wow, fantastic. i like the font and color for his name. it is creative yet personal.

person alpha:
yes, it is a bold design. people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card. it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations.

person beta:
i agree. business cards are great tools for promoting personal business. it won't take much time to design an amazing card, but it can make a big difference among the crowd. and you'll always notice it from your collection. for they have outspoken colors, own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card. i wish to have one like this. but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow.

person alpha:
excuse me. this bus goes downtown, doesn't it?

person alpha:

person beta:
do you like animals?

person alpha:
yes, doesn't everyone?

person beta:
what's your favorite animal?

person alpha:
it's hard to say. while dogs are more affectionate, cats are much easier to take care of.

person beta:
have you ever had a dog?

person alpha:
when i was little, we had a few domestic dogs at home.

person beta:
they always say that dogs are a man's best friends. do you think that's true?

person alpha:
definitely. rich or poor, dogs always love their masters.

person beta:
how about cats? have you ever had one for a pet?

person alpha:
i had one a few months ago, but she ended up running away.

person beta:
how did that happen?

person alpha:
she left through a window that was open one night and never returned.

person beta:
you must have been devastated!

person alpha:
i was pretty sad. i still hope that she'll return some day!

person beta:
i hope she does. do you think you'll ever get another pet?

person alpha:
i think i will. it's difficult to feel longly when you have a pet around.

person beta:
i hope your cat finds its way back home.

person alpha:
i do, too.

person beta:
have you moved into your new house yet, michael?

person alpha:
we just moved in yesterday, actually.

person beta:
so, what do you think about the place? are you glad that you moved in?

person alpha:
it's great! unfortunately, we're going to spend a fortune doing everything up.

person beta:
how old is the house then?

person alpha:
it's about 200 years old. it has a lot of history!

person beta:
sounds fascinating. where is your new house located?

person alpha:
it's just off of the ring road.

person beta:
do you have a big yard?

person alpha:
it's bigger than our last one. i've got flowers in the front, and fruits, vegetables and a fish pond in the back.

person beta:
is your house well-lit?

person alpha:
oh, yes. our windows let plenty of natural light in. they've also got wonderful views of the park behind our house.

person beta:
how many rooms does your house have?

person alpha:
right now, there are three bedrooms, two barrooms, a kitchen, a sitting room, a dining room, and a living room. we're hoping to add on a green room and a guest bedroom. in fact, when the guest room i

person beta:
i'd be up for that!

person alpha:
we have achieved great success last year.the most important is that we realize our strength lies in after-sale service.

person beta:
your achievement is obvious to all.

person alpha:
what we will do is to strengthen it.

person beta:
yes, this is also the competitive edge of our company.

person alpha:
i'm hungry, let's go grab a bite to eat.

person beta:
yeah me too. oh! can we stop at the shop really fast? i lost my makeup bag at the airport and i want to pick up a few things.

person alpha:
will you take long?

person beta:
no! five minutes i promise!

person alpha:
come on! we have been here for almost an hour! i thought you said you were only going to get a few things! how long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish!

person beta:
are you crazy? you have no idea what you are talking about! just for my eyes i have to get eye-liner, an eyelash curler, eye shadow, an eyebrow pencil and mascara. then i need to get foundation, liq

person alpha:
whoa whoa whoa! are you nuts? how much is all this going to cost? i'm looking at the price at each one of these little things and it's outrageous! this is basically a crayon!

person beta:
what about you? you spend as much or more money on your razors, after shave, cologne and gel! not to mention how much you spend on clothes and...

person alpha:
fine! get the stupid thirty dollar crayon!

person beta:
a cup of coffee sounds good, doesn't it?

person alpha:
yes, but i think i'll have orange juice first.

person beta:
do you feel like having anything to eat?

person alpha:
well, i think i'll try the pancakes. how about you?

person beta:
sounds great. that's just what i feel like having.

person alpha:
they're here! now that's speedy service! and they arrived within two days of each other!

person beta:
what are you waiting for? rip'em open!

person alpha:
wow... this shirt is nice, but looks big.

person beta:
it's nice, but how much did you end up paying?

person alpha:
with the shipping included--seventy dollars.

person beta:
hmm... not so hot. they sell them here for about that.

person alpha:
what's the side dish that you're making for dinner?

person beta:
i'm not sure. i was thinking of making a vegetable.

person alpha:
what kind of vegetable are you thinking about making?

person beta:
do you know what kind of vegetable you want to eat?

person alpha:
why don't you make some corn?

person beta:
how would you like the corn?

person alpha:
i don't understand what you mean.

person beta:
do you want it boiled, grilled, or microwaved?

person alpha:
why don't you grill it?

person beta:
that's how you want it?

person alpha:
yeah, that sounds delicious.

person beta:
okay, i'll grill some corn then.

person alpha:
how slowly you drive!

person beta:
i'm sorry. something is wrong with my taxi.

person alpha:
where does it go wrong?

person beta:
let me stop my car for check. oh, my god. i got a flat tyre.

person alpha:
can it keep going?

person beta:
sorry. you'd better get off for taking another taxi.

person alpha:
mom, where are you going?

person beta:
i am going to buy some food to cook for supper.

person alpha:
good. i wanna come with you.

person beta:
how strange! our little emperor now asks to help out with shopping.

person alpha:
we learnt about vegetables and meat at school. but i never see the real thing.

person beta:
wow, that's something new. let's go! what's this, honey?

person alpha:
er, is it cabbage?

person beta:
cabbage? is that what they teach at school now? ok, honey, it's spinage.

person alpha:
yeah, i know, this is popeye's favorite food.

person beta:

person beta:
that will be no problem. we never use any kind of inferior packaging. your goods will be safe.

person alpha:
good. can we ask you to put a country of origin mark on each container?

person beta:
we always do that, but i will make a point to check it for you since it is so important.

person alpha:
do you always put a quality mark on each container? for this shipment it is crucial to us that you do.

person beta:
we don't usually do that unless we are asked to. i'li tell my staff to take care of this for you.

person alpha:
thanks. this shipment is so important to us there cannot be any foul-ups.

person beta:
our afghan customers wanna buy china's tea. i am thinking of placing an order with you.

i'm getting a tattoo tomorrow.

person alpha:
are you nuts?

person beta:
john, i'm sorry, the air tickets for the international day are sold out.

person alpha:
really? i didn't expect that.

person beta:
it's possible because everyone wants to travel during the holiday weekend.

person alpha:
i should have booked the tickets in advance.

person beta:
take it easy. i'll like you know if anyone decides to cancel his reservation.

person alpha:
can you tell me where it hurts?

person beta:
i am so glad they called you. it feels like something is really wrong with my stomach!

person alpha:
does it hurt when i push here?

person beta:
it's mostly on my right side. right here!

person alpha:
have you been feeling this way for awhile?

person beta:
i started feeling kind of sick last night after dinner, but this morning the pain got really bad!

person alpha:
have you eaten anything unusual lately?

person beta:
no, not that i remember.

person alpha:
we are going to take you to an emergency room right now.

person beta:
i will feel better when i know what the problem is. thank you for the drugs.

person alpha:
good morning, sir. can i help you?

person beta:
i think i know it. i wonder whether the agreement has the guarantee of law or not.

person alpha:

person beta:
( sign.) ok, i signed the agreement with the signature of my name.

person alpha:
we are done with the agreement. after a three-month probationary period, you will be confirmed in your post.

person beta:
i see. thank you very much.

person alpha:
you are welcome.

person beta:
what do you do besides work and watching tv?

person alpha:
when i have some time, i like to exercise.

person beta:
do you go jogging or do you go to a health club?

person alpha:
i joined samsung health club a couple of months ago.

person beta:
how do you exercise?

person alpha:
i usually spend 30 minutes on the bicycle for the carpio, and then i lift weight for about 45 minutes.

person beta:
how often do you go?

person alpha:
i want to go four times a week, but i'm too lazy. last week, i only went to workout once.

person beta:
hi, mark! long time no see!

person alpha:
hi, alex!

person beta:
where have you been?

person alpha:
i just got back from london.

person beta:
how was your flight?

person alpha:
it was ok. there was a lot of turbulence, though.

person beta:
that's too bad. how long was the flight?

person alpha:
it was 10 hours.

person beta:
did you have a layover?

person alpha:
yes, in paris, france.

person beta:

person alpha:

person beta:

person alpha:

person beta:
yeah. let me see if he'll do it, and i'll get back to you.

person alpha:
ok. just keep in mind it has to be somebody who can get along with elvin.

person beta:

person alpha:
may i help you?

person beta:
i needed to ask you a question.

person alpha:
ask away.

person beta:
how many hours of the behind-the-wheel course do i need to take?

person alpha:
why do you need to take the course?

person beta:
i want to get my license.

person alpha:
you have to do six hours behind the wheel.

person beta:
how many days do i need to finish the course?

person alpha:
you can't finish in less than three days.

person beta:
is that all?

person alpha:
there's nothing else to it.

person beta:
that sounds easy enough.

person alpha:
peter, go and tidy up your toys now.

person beta:
wait a moment, mom.

person alpha:
i'm mad! i said now! turn off the tv, and do it now.

person beta:
mom, just ten more minutes. the show is going to be over soon.

person alpha:
peter, if you don't do it soon, i will throw your toys in the trash can.

person beta:
excuse me. do you speak english?

person alpha:
yes, i do. how can i help you?

person beta:
well, i've just arrived in my room, but there are no instructions in english about the facilities available! could you help me for a moment?

person alpha:
of course not. what exactly would you like to know?

person beta:
first, what is the number for room service?

person alpha:
it's 1200. room service is available 24 hours a day.

person beta:
very good. now, could you help me to adjust the air conditioning, please? it's too hot in my room.

person alpha:
yes, the control unit is on the wall next to the bathroom. is 24 deg c all right?

person beta:
yes, that's perfect. another thing, if need more items for the mini-bar, which number should i call?

person alpha:
you should call the housekeeping department on 2300. they will replace any stock for you immediately.

person beta:
i see. so, is it possible to make international phone calls from my room?

person alpha:
that's no problem. just dial 9 to get an outside line, and then dial the number as usual.

person beta:
well, thanks a lot for your help.

person alpha:
no problem, sir. if there's anything else you need, you can find me at the desk by the elevator, or you can call housekeeping if i'm not there.

person beta:
ok, goodbye.

person alpha:
goodbye, sir.

person beta:
i need some flowers for my girlfriend.

person alpha:
no problem. would you like some artificial carnations?

person beta:
oh, no. carnations are not very elegant. artificial flowers have no passion.

person alpha:
how much did you want to spend?

person beta:
money is no object.

person alpha:
our most elegant flower is golden lily.

person beta:
i will take ten.

person alpha:
do you want to add some baby's breath for that? they are equally popular now.

person beta:
of course. can i have it delivered to my girlfriend's house this afternoon?

person alpha:
yes, but there is a five dollars delivery charge.

person beta:
that's ok. here is the address.

person alpha:
good morning. what can i do for you?

person beta:
good morning, i have a bad cough, and i want to see an internist.

person alpha:
do you have a registration card?

person beta:
no, i don't. i'm a tourist.

person alpha:
then you need to register as a new patient. can i have a look at you id card? i need your name, age, occupation, address and contacting number.

person beta:
here you are.

person alpha:
thanks. which kind of medicine do you prefer, western medicine or traditional chinese medicine?

person beta:
i'd like to try traditional chinese medicine. i heard it really works quite well if you know what you're doing.

person alpha:
all right. yes, he does. the registration fee is 7 yuan, please.

person beta:
hey there chris, what are you up to?

person alpha:
i'm just poring over some brochures about various car models.

person beta:
oh, so you're thinking about buying a new car?

person alpha:
yeah, it looks that way. my wife has been bugging me about it. i thought we could probably survive without one, but with a baby on the way, maybe it is time to get a car.

person beta:
so this would be your first automobile?

person alpha:
that's right. for quite a few years, i rode a bicycle to work. then i got a motorbike.

person beta:
yeah, i think i can understand your wife's position. asking her to ride on a motorcycle when she's pregnant is a tall order.

person alpha:
oh... i don't let her ride with me. it's just too dangerous. she takes the bus to work, but it is sometimes difficult to get a seat and it's crowded and hot.

person beta:
so it's time to buy your very first car! wow, that's exciting!

person alpha:
yes, but it's also a pretty big financial responsibility.

person beta:
yeah. i still remember my first car. it was an old clunker that my dad gave me when i turned 17. i drove it around for a couple of years until i scraped together enough money to buy a better secondhand car.

person alpha:
i'm having a hard time deciding which model is best for us.

person beta:
yeah, it is a tough call. each one has its pros and cons. are you looking for a sedan?

person alpha:
yes, i'd like a jeep, but my wife says we have to get a comfortable sedan for long drives home to see her relatives.

person beta:
i'd advise you to listen to your wife. she will be sitting in the back taking care of the kids so whatever she prefers is probably the best choice.

person alpha:
can i help you?

person beta:
i'd like to send a fax to shenzhen.

person alpha:
is it a photograph or a document?

person beta:
each of both.

person alpha:
could i see both of them?

person beta:
here you are.

person alpha:
you can't send this document; it is not clear enough to send. the photograph is all right.

person beta:
well, how long will it take to arrive in shenzhen?

person alpha:
couple of minutes.

person beta:
great. how much?

person alpha:
5$. you should change another much clearer photograph for fax.

person beta:
thank you. i will deal with it.

person alpha:
good morning, can i see your passport, please?

person beta:
here you are.

person alpha:
for business or pleasure?

person beta:
business.

person alpha:
thank you. have a pleasant stay.

person beta:
take care, peter. don't run so fast. are you tired?

person alpha:
oh, yes. may i sit on the grass?

person beta:
no, you mustn't sit on the grass. don't you see the notes?

person alpha:
yes, i can see it. but what's on it?

person beta:
it says'keep off the grass!'

person alpha:
well, there's a bench under the tree. we can sit there.

person beta:
be careful. you can't smoke here.

person alpha:
why not?

person beta:
can't you see the notes there? it says'no smoking here'.

person alpha:
i'd like a double room.

person beta:
do you have a reservation?

person alpha:
yes, i called you last week from new york. my name is george lee.

person beta:
wait a second, pls. yes, mr. lee, we have a room reserved for you. how long do you plan to stay?

person alpha:
probably two days. my wife will join me tomorrow. then we will decide when to leave for seattle.

person beta:
would you sign the register, pls?

person alpha:
by the way, does my room have a private bath?

person beta:
certainly, every room in this hotel has a private bath.

person alpha:
does my room have twin beds or a double? i prefer a room with twin beds.

person beta:
your room has twin beds, mr.lee. it also has a view. i am sure you will like it. this is your key. it's on the eighth floor room 801. the elevator's over there.

person alpha:
thank you. one more thing, where is your restaurant?

person beta:
the restaurant is on the second floor. we also have a cafeteria on the top floor. if you would like something to drink, you can either call room service or come down here. the bar is right behind the lobby.

person alpha:
thank you, you are very kind!

person beta:
you are welcome!

person alpha:
i need to find a bus that'll take me to the gold line.

person beta:
where do you live?

person alpha:
i live up in altadena.

person beta:
the 264 will take you there.

person alpha:
it goes all the way there?

person beta:
i know for a fact that it goes to the station.

person alpha:
what street would i catch it on?

person beta:
if you go to altadena drive, you can catch it there.

person alpha:
i didn't know that bus went to the gold line station.

person beta:
yup, it does.

person alpha:
well, thanks for letting me know.

person beta:
it was my pleasure.

person alpha:
may i help you?

person beta:
i have a problem.

person alpha:
what's the problem?

person beta:
someone else is making charges on my debit card.

person alpha:
i need to see a statement for your debit card.

person beta:
i have it right here.

person alpha:
can you show me which charges you're referring to?

person beta:
the last four charges.

person alpha:
we will need to do an investigation on this.

person beta:
how long will that take?

person alpha:
we'll have to freeze payment on those charges until the investigation is finished.

person beta:
i really appreciate your help.

person alpha:
do you think we can go driving right now?

person beta:
yeah, sure. let's go.

person alpha:
buckle up.

person beta:
all right. now what?

person alpha:
now you put the key in the ignition and start the car.

person beta:
which direction should i take?

person alpha:
make a left on this next street.

person beta:
tell me how far to go.

person alpha:
keep going until i tell you to stop.

person beta:
okay, but let me know ahead of time.

person alpha:
that's all for today, so park right there.

person beta:
that was great. thanks for taking me driving.

person alpha:
i'm after some chinese incense burner? how's this one?

person beta:
how's this one?

person alpha:
oh, i need a small one, otherwise my luggage will be overweight.

person beta:
what about this one?

person alpha:
oh, this is fine.

person beta:
hello. this is the holiday inn. can i help you?

person alpha:
hi. is there a special rate for a group reservation?

person beta:
yes. there is a 20% to 40% discount. it depends on the season.during the summer the discount is 20%. during the winter it is 40%.

person alpha:
i need five single rooms in october. how much of a discount can i get?

person beta:
our summer season ended in september. so the discount will be 40%. that's a good deal. would you prefer rooms with a front view or rear view?

person alpha:
front view, please.

person beta:
what date and time will you be checking in?

person alpha:
october 25th around 2:00 in the afternoon.

person beta:
we need you to send a deposit for 1/3 of the bill. you can send the check, or you can use the credit card.

person alpha:
ok. i'll send a check.

person beta:
could you tell me your name, address and phone number, please?

person alpha:
sure. my name is anderson. my address is 109 ferguson east, holton. and my phone number is 309 789 1267.

person beta:
thanks.

person alpha:
how much further do we have to walk?

person beta:
it's about 3 kilometers.

person alpha:
shall we have a rest here? i am tired out.

person beta:
why not walk further to the tree over there?

person alpha:
good idea. so we can rest in the shadow of the tree.

person beta:
i need your help.

person alpha:
oh, what's up?

person beta:
i locked myself out. what do you suggest i do?

person alpha:
well, the best thing to do is to go down to the front desk and ask for a duplicate key.

person beta:
ahhs! i'm beat!

person alpha:
what happened to you? you look like you got hit by a tornado!

person beta:
i just got back from fighting the crowds.

person alpha:
you mean at the mall? was there a sale?

person beta:
yeah. for five minutes, everything was half off. it was total chaos...

person alpha:
cool!

person beta:
grabbing, pushing and shoving...

person alpha:
do you have a swimming pool in this hotel?

person beta:
we don't have a swimming pool, sir, but we do have swim stations in the gym.

person alpha:
i never heard of a swim station. is that like a train or bus station?

person beta:
it's just a deep bathtub with a current of water that you swim against.

person alpha:
holy cow! i never heard of such a thing. how much do they cost?

person beta:
as a guest, sir, you pay nothing.

person alpha:
this sounds better every second. now, when can i use the stations?

person beta:
if you want to swim, you can visit the gym any day between 7 a. m. and 10 p. m.

person alpha:
oh, boy! this is going to be great. i'm going to the gym right now!

person beta:
i'm sure you'll enjoy your workout, sir. everyone seems to like the swim stations.

person alpha:
excuse me, bill?

person beta:
hi, christine. how's it going?

person alpha:
fine, thanks. mr. emory would like to meet with mr. macmillan tomorrow afternoon. can you take a look at his book?

person beta:
sure, just a second. all right, what time?

person alpha:
sir, may i help you?

person beta:
yes, i want to book a room.

person alpha:
sure. what kind of room do you like?

person beta:
well, could you let me see the room?

person alpha:
ok. what about this one?

person beta:
it's fine. what beautiful scenery outside the window! i think this one will do.

person alpha:
i am glad you like it.

person beta:
i'd like to buy a bottle of centrum, a dozen tooth brushes, some baby's wipes, and a small bottle of aspirin.

person alpha:
centrum? we have bottles of thirty and one hundred tablets. which kind do you want?

person beta:
give me one bottle of one hundred tablets.

person alpha:
and what kind of toothbrushes would you like?

person beta:
can i have a look at them?

person alpha:
sure. this brand is supposed to be very good, but they're expensive. those are new products. they come in several colors and sizes. there is also hard, soft, and medium.

person beta:
are they cheaper?

person alpha:
this one is 10% off. that one has no reduction, but you can get a free tube of toothpaste with six toothbrushes.

person beta:
so if i buy a dozen, i'll get two free tubes of toothpaste?

person alpha:
that's right.

person beta:
good. i'll take a dozen of them then.

person alpha:
and here is your aspirin. what else did you say you want?

person beta:
baby's wipes. johnson's.

person alpha:
anything else?

person beta:
well, actually i'd like to buy some vitamins for my son. he's five months old. can you suggest any?

person alpha:
sure. here you are. this one is excellent. just mix one drop of it with milk.

person beta:
thanks. that'll be all.

person alpha:
excuse me, did you see a set of keys?

person beta:
what kind of keys?

person alpha:
five keys and a small foot ornament.

person beta:
what a shame! i didn't see them.

person alpha:
well, can you help me look for it? that's my first time here.

person beta:
sure. it's my pleasure. i'd like to help you look for the missing keys.

person alpha:
it's very kind of you.

person beta:
it's not a big deal.hey, i found them.

person alpha:
oh, thank god! i don't know how to thank you, guys.

person beta:

person alpha:
would you fill out this form?

person beta:
ok. here you are.

person alpha:
all right. and here's your deposit book.

person beta:
thank you. goodbye.

person alpha:

person beta:
good morning, mr. smith. welcome to wuhan.

person alpha:
good morning!

person beta:
mr. smith, did you have a good journey?

person alpha:
i just feel a little tired. you know, it took me 16 hours to get here.

person beta:
you must take a rest today.

person alpha:
that's very kind of you, but i can do without a rest. i have long wanted to have a talk with you about the possibility of business between us.

person beta:
we welcome good business. anyhow, we know you must get tired by the flight, so we arrange a meeting tomorrow. today you can have a good rest.

person alpha:
thank you very much.

person beta:
we hope your stay here a pleasant one!

person alpha:
i believe i will.

person beta:
excuse me! what time is it? my watch stopped.

person alpha:
let me see. it's 9

person beta:
is your watch right?

person alpha:
i think so. i set it by the radio this morning.

person beta:
by the way, can you tell me what the date it is today, and what day it is, please?

person alpha:
well, it's the 10th and on the tuesday.

person beta:
good afternoon. can i help you?

person alpha:
i'd like to leave this bag with you.

person beta:
ok, sir. is there anything valuable or breakable in it?

person alpha:
well... there is a necklace in it.

person beta:
would you mind taking the necklace with you, or leaving it at the safe deposit box?

person alpha:
well, don't bother. i'll take it with me. will that be all right?

person beta:
thank you, sir. here is your tag. this cloakroom is open till 11:00 p. m., could you pick it up by then?

person alpha:
sure. thank you.

person beta:
the atm machine outside won't give me back my card.

person alpha:
let's go take a look at it. do you have your id with you?

person beta:
yes, here it is.

person alpha:
okay, i see the problem. you forgot your code, didn't you?

person beta:
how did you know?

person alpha:
the machine gives you three attempts to enter the correct code and after that it assumes that you are not the real owner and confiscates it.

person beta:
oh. but can i have my card back now?

person alpha:
yes, i can get it for you but i need to go back inside the bank.

person beta:
what's the name of the girl that has just passed us?

person alpha:
her name is rose.why?

person beta:
she's so pretty. i'd like to make friends with her.

person alpha:
oh, shut up.she's already got married.

person beta:
excuse me, sir. are there only 3 programs in your hotel?

person alpha:
of course not. we have 50 channels in all.

person beta:
well. i am afraid it must be my fault. can you send someone here to help me?

person alpha:
ok. i will send a maid to your room right now.

person beta:
how do you feel?

person alpha:
i'm getting sleepy.

person beta:
you've had so long a flight.

person alpha:
time difference also makes me feel weak.

person beta:
oh, i forgot about it.

person alpha:
it's four o'clock in the morning in chicago now, but it's time to go to bed in shanghai.

person beta:
don't think so much. take a good sleep and you'll feel better soon.

person alpha:
good afternoon, peace restaurant, may i help you?

person beta:
i'd like to reserve a table for two, my wife and i.

person alpha:
yes, sir. what time would you like, sir?

person beta:
i'm not sure. perhaps around 8 pm.

person alpha:
fine, a reserve a table for two at 8 pm, sir, may i have your name, please?

person beta:
juliet, juliet berman.

person alpha:
thank you, mr.berman. and you prefer smoking or non-smoking?

person beta:
non-smoking will be fine, please. but it is more important that you get a table by the window. it's our anniversary, and i'd like to be very special.

person alpha:
i'll try my best. with a toward to having with this tonight, mr.berman.

person beta:
thank you, goodbye.

person alpha:
goodbye, and have a nice day.

person beta:
good morning, may. good girl, you are reading english books again.

person alpha:
good morning. there is no reason to miss so beautiful a morning. is that a new bird?

person beta:
oh, yes, my daughter bought it yesterday. we call her lulu.

person alpha:
it looks so cute. is it a parrot?

person beta:
yes. just look at her colorful feathers. what else can it be?

person alpha:
i see. it's interesting that there is also a parrot in my english book. his mane is polly.

person beta:
really? a foreign parrot!

person alpha:
he can speak english, too.

person beta:
maybe you can teach lulu some english words.

person alpha:
lulu. lulu. say hello. hello. oh, she is so smart. good bird.

person beta:
my mp3 player is broken, so i want to change it for an mp4 player. can you offer any advice about which brand and model to buy?

person alpha:
an mp4 player? why don't you buy a new cell phone? you can find an mp4 player inside any of the latest cell phones.

person beta:
oh, that's a good idea. perhaps i should have a try.

person alpha:
look at my cell phone. i can listen to music, watch movies, take pictures, play games, surf the web and download documents. it's just like a pad.

person beta:
that's cool. i can use the computer and the internet pretty well, but i'm a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products.

person alpha:
that's ok. you know, digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry, and they won't cost you too much.

person beta:
yeah, if i buy a cell phone like this, i don't have to take a music player everywhere i go, and i can save the cost of buying an extra mp4.

person alpha:
that's right. what's the flash memory of your old mp3?

person beta:
256mb.

person alpha:
then any cell phone can meet your need because they generally have memories of over 512mb.

person beta:
what can i get you?

person alpha:
a cheeseburger and an order of french fries would be great.

person beta:
would you like anything to drink?

person alpha:
i feel like having a coke.
