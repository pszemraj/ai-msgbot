person alpha:
hey man, you wanna buy some weed?

person beta:
some what?

person alpha:
weed! you know? pot, ganja, mary jane some chronic!

person beta:
oh, umm, no thanks.

person alpha:
i also have blow if you prefer to do a few lines.

person beta:
no, i am ok, really.

person alpha:
come on man! i even got dope and acid! try some!

person beta:
do you really have all of these drugs? where do you get them from?

person alpha:
i got my connections! just tell me what you want and i'll even give you one ounce for free.

person beta:
sounds good! let's see, i want.

person alpha:
yeah?

person beta:
i want you to put your hands behind your head! you are under arrest!

person alpha:
the taxi drivers are on strike again.

person beta:
what for?

person alpha:
they want the government to reduce the price of the gasoline.

person beta:
it is really a hot potato.

person alpha:
we've managed to reduce our energy consumption in our factory by about 15 per cent in the last two years.

person beta:
that's excellent. how have you managed that?

person alpha:
mainly because we've invested in a heat recovery system.

person beta:
what does that mean exactly?

person alpha:
well, we use the exhaust gases from our printing presses to provide energy to heat our dryers.

person beta:
what other sources of energy do you use?

person alpha:
we don't use any fossil fuels. most of our power comes from hydro-electric plants. we're hoping to use even more energy from alternative sources in the future- perhaps even wind power.

person beta:
believe it or not, tea is the most popular beverage in the world after water.

person alpha:
well, people from asia to europe all enjoy tea.

person beta:
right. and china is the homeland of tea.

person alpha:
yes, chinese people love drinking tea so much. some even claim they can't live without tea.

person beta:
do you know there are several catagories of chinese tea?

person alpha:
yes, i believe there are green teas, black teas and scented teas. any others?

person beta:
well, have you ever heard of oulong tea and compressed tea?

person alpha:
oh, yeah. oulong tea is good for one's health. isn't it?

person beta:
you surely know a lot about chinese tea.

person alpha:
sure, i like drinking tea at teahouses.

person beta:
oh, so do i.

person alpha:
why don't we go for one now?

person beta:
great. we can chat while enjoying a cup there.

person alpha:
let's go!

person beta:
what are your personal weaknesses?

person alpha:
i'm afraid i'm a poor talker. i'm not comfortable talking with the people whom i have just met for the first time. that is not very good for business, so i have been studying public speaking.

person beta:
are you more of a leader or a follower?

person alpha:
i don't try to lead people. i'd rather cooperate with everybody, and get the job done by working together.

person beta:
do you think you can make yourself easily understood in english?

person alpha:
yes, in most circumstances.

person beta:
are you available for travel?

person alpha:
yes, i like travelling. i am young, and unmarried. it's no problem for me to travel frequently.

person beta:
how long will it take us to drive to london?

person alpha:
i think it's a distance of 180 kilometers from here to london, so it should be a two-hour drive on the motorway.

person beta:
that's unless there is a traffic jam. it could take three hours.

person alpha:
you're right. we will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey, because we will be in built-up areas.

person beta:
so, shall we allow three hours to cover the distance?

person alpha:
ok. you haven't seen my company car, have you?

person beta:
no. let me take a look... it's longer than my car.

person alpha:
i think it's over five meters long. i can't remember exactly. it has a maximum speed of over 200 kilometers an hour.

person beta:
wow! that's fast! i don't think we will be traveling that fast on the motorway.

person alpha:
we can't. if we went that fast, we would break the speed limit.

person beta:
so how did i do on my driving test?

person alpha:
do you want the truth?

person beta:
of course, i do.

person alpha:
well, you really didn't do all that well.

person beta:
how bad did i do?

person alpha:
to be completely honest, you failed your test.

person beta:
how?

person alpha:
there were a number of reasons.

person beta:
what were they?

person alpha:
basically, you just can't drive.

person beta:
can i have another try?

person alpha:
you can take it in a couple weeks.

person beta:
good morning. what's the matter with you?

person alpha:
good morning, doctor. i have a terrible headache.

person beta:
all right, young man. tell me how it got started.

person alpha:
yesterday i had a runny nose. now my nose is stuffed up. i have a sore throat. and i'm afraid i've got a temperature. i feel terrible.

person beta:
don't worry, young man. lat me give you an examination. first let me take a look at your throat. open your mouth and say'ah'.

person alpha:
ah.

person beta:
your throat is inflamed. and your tongue is heavily coated. you have all the symptoms of influenza.

person alpha:
what am i supposed to do then?

person beta:
a good rest is all you need, and drink more water. i'll write you a prescription.

person alpha:
thank you very much.

person beta:
my dear, what's for supper?

person alpha:
red cooked carp and rape with fresh mushrooms.

person beta:
what about soup?

person alpha:
sour-peppery soup.

person beta:
which condiment do you use for?

person alpha:
i'll use ginger, garlic scallion, hot pepper and vinegar.

person beta:
very good, need i help you?

person alpha:
no, don't need, i can do myself.

person beta:
thanks. i can watch tv now.

person alpha:
but you must cook that dinner next time.

person beta:
okay, i'll do it next time.

person alpha:
hello, this is mike, kara.

person beta:
mike! good to hear from you. how are you?

person alpha:
everything is fine, and how are you?

person beta:
things are going well with me.

person alpha:
kara, i had fun the other night at the movies and was wondering if you would like to go out again this friday.

person beta:
mike, i don't think that it's a good idea to go out again. i really need to focus on getting packed and ready to move back home.

person alpha:
maybe we could just meet for coffee or something.

person beta:
i can't really deal with any distractions right now, but i appreciate the nice evening we spent together.

person alpha:
sun-set hotel. may i help you?

person beta:
yes, i have booked a room for 24th. it's a double room.

person beta:
well, now i want to change the date from 24th to 28th.

person alpha:
ok, that shall be arranged.

person beta:
are you busy tomorrow morning?

person alpha:
i'm free. what's up?

person beta:
someone has to pick up the boss at the airport.

person alpha:
oh, i just remembered i've got a report to write.

person beta:
i'm sorry i'm so late. i had a really bad day.

person alpha:
it's ten after six.we're late.but dinner is at six thirty.

person beta:

person alpha:
nonsmoking. now, is a queen-size bed okay?

person beta:
no problem.

person alpha:

person beta:
of course! it's area code 626-555-1739.

person alpha:
thank you so much, mr. sandals. we look forward to seeing you!

person beta:
could i have my bill, please?

person alpha:
certainly, sir.

person beta:
i'm afraid there's been a mistake.

person alpha:
i'm sorry, sir. what seems to be the trouble?

person beta:
i believe you have charged me twice for the same thing. look, the figure of 6.5 dollar appears here, then again here.

person alpha:
i'll just go and check it for you, sir.

person beta:
good evening, madam. can i help you?

person alpha:
yes. i bought this sheet here yesterday.

person beta:
anything wrong with it?

person alpha:
yes. when i spread it out back home, i found this hole.

person beta:
oh, how awful! may i have a look at the invoice?

person alpha:
here it is.

person beta:
well. please accept our sincere apologies, i'll be glad to change it for another one if you wish.

person alpha:
that's very kind of you. thank you.

person beta:
we're sorry that this has happened, and i guarantee that the same mistake won't happen again.

person alpha:
i need to buy some flowers for my wife.

person beta:
perhaps you'd be interested in red roses.

person alpha:
what would the roses cost me?

person beta:
they're only$ 20 a dozen.

person alpha:
i like the sound of that.

person beta:
yes, that is today's sale price.

person alpha:
a dozen will be fine.

person beta:
is there anything else you'd like to get?

person alpha:
no, thank you.

person beta:
these roses should make your wife very happy.

person alpha:
room service, is there anything i can do for you?

person beta:
yes, i am afraid there are not enough outlets.

person alpha:
well, we have 6 for each room.

person beta:
yes, but 4 of them are broken. can you send someone here?

person alpha:
ok sir, please wait a minute.

person beta:
why'd you pull me over?

person alpha:
are you aware that you drove through a red light?

person beta:
i ran a red light?

person alpha:
yes, you did.

person beta:
i apologize, but i didn't realize that i did.

person alpha:
weren't you taught that yellow means slow down, not speed up?

person beta:
i did learn that.

person alpha:
so, then why did you speed up?

person beta:
i don't know what to tell you.

person alpha:
i'm going to have to write you a ticket.

person beta:
i understand.

person alpha:
here you go. don't do that again.

person beta:
can i have the roll of film developed here?

person alpha:

person alpha:
i really need to start eating healthier.

person beta:
i have to start eating better too.

person alpha:
what kind of food do you usually eat?

person beta:
i try my best to eat only fruits, vegetables, and chicken.

person alpha:
is that really all that you eat?

person beta:
that's basically it.

person alpha:
how do you stick to only those foods?

person beta:
actually, fruits and veggies are really good for you.

person alpha:
yeah, i know, but what about the chicken?

person beta:
i mainly eat baked chicken, because there's not a lot of fat.

person alpha:
that does sound pretty good.

person beta:
i know it does, and that's because it is.

person alpha:
good afternoon! can i help you?

person beta:
could you show me where the chinesc-style clothing is located? i want to buy a silk coat.

person alpha:
this way, please. here they are. they're all handmade.

person beta:
oh, they look nice. may i try that black one on?

person alpha:
of course. the fitting room is right over there.

person alpha:

person beta:
can i help you?

person alpha:
i would actually like to view the apartment for rent today.

person beta:
i'm sorry, but you won't be able to view it today.

person alpha:
why not?

person beta:
you have to make an appointment first.

person alpha:
oh, okay. can i do that right now?

person beta:
is this friday okay?

person alpha:
is 6 o'clock friday evening okay?

person beta:
yes, i will schedule you for that time.

person alpha:
thank you very much. see you then.

person beta:
today i want to invite you to talk about insurance you're interested in.

person alpha:
thank you. i wonder whether i can enjoy the life insurance and health insurance.

person beta:
of course. a two-week paid vacation a year, a five-day workweek.

person alpha:
good. anything else?

person beta:
yes, all the insurance will be linked with your work. we will issue an insurance policy.

person alpha:
next, please. hello, may i help you, sir?

person beta:
yes, i want to send a registered airmail letter to france.

person alpha:

person alpha:

person beta:
thank you very much.

person alpha:
you're welcome.

person beta:
we really were lucky. we got the last available table for two---and we didn't even have a reservation! did you see the long lines behind us?

person alpha:
yeah, i'm glad that we didn't have to wait long. i'm starving!

person beta:
let's take a look at the menu so we can order. do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share?

person alpha:
what would you rather have, samosas or poppadoms?

person beta:
i heard that one of their specialities is the samosa.

person alpha:
well, let's get a plate of those then.

person beta:
sounds good. what are you going to have for your main course?

person alpha:
i think i might have a dahl.

person beta:
what's in a dahl?

person alpha:
it's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice.

person beta:
that sounds nice. do you want to share some kebabs as well?

person alpha:
ok. how about some lamb kebabs?

person beta:
that's my favourite. do you want to have some wine or beer?

person alpha:
i think i'll have a beer.

person beta:
ok, shall i flag down the waitress?

person alpha:
i wouldn't recommend it. i think we should wait until she comes round.

person beta:
you're right. that might seem a bit rude. it's a good thing i've got you with me!

person alpha:
what would you do without me?

person beta:
this position demands a higher writing ability, so please say something about your writing ability.

person alpha:
of course. i've loved writing since i was a very little boy. i won the first prize in a national composition contest when i was in middle school. after attending nanjing university, i never give up writing. my works, such as father's tobacco pipe, open air cinema, the old city were respectively published china youth daily, yangzi evening news, and new beijing. during the period of studying for my degrees of master and doctor, i paid more attention to developing my research ability and published several papers. the impact of internet in chinese political participation, the discipline of remold, the historical direction of chinese administration reform, bribery cases of self governance in chinese villages are respectively published in chinese publish administration, beijing due xuebao, theory and society and chinese reform. i joined in yangzi evening news to work as a part-time journalist in 2006. during this period, i've written a lot of comments, which improved my writing ability to a new level, i have full confidence in my writing ability, and i believe i can do the job well.

person beta:
pompous. how may i help you?

person alpha:
yes, i'd like to reserve a table for dinner.

person beta:
how large a group are you expecting?

person alpha:
six couples.

person beta:
would you like to reserve a private dining room?

person alpha:
that sounds like a good idea.

person beta:
all right. may i have your name, sir?

person alpha:
my name is ron kollwitz.

person beta:
ms. wang, this is mr. cooper, president of ivy publishing.

person alpha:
it's nice to meet you, mr. cooper.

person beta:
nice to meet you, ms. wang. you must be exhausted after your long trip from canada.

person alpha:
yes, it was quite a long flight. i'm glad to finally be here.

person beta:
can you help me now?

person alpha:
no, but i'll be able to tomorrow.

person beta:
that'll be too late.

person alpha:
why don't you ask bill if he can help?

person beta:
i did, but he wasn't able to either.

person alpha:
have you got any experience in advertising?

person beta:
yes, i have been working in the public relations section of a company in the past two years. i plan the advertising campaign and cooperate the work of artists and typographers. sometimes i have to do the work of a specialist when there's something urgent.

person alpha:
do you have any practical experience as a secretary?

person beta:
yes, sir. i acted as a secretary in an insurance company.

person alpha:
would you tell me the essential qualities a secretary should maintain?

person beta:
well, to begin with, i would say she needs to be diligent, and the second point is that she has to do a lot of things on her own initiative. finally, she can make notes in shorthand and types and has the skills in report writing, summary writing, keep minutes at meetings, and so on. most important of all is that she seems to have a better memory than average.

person alpha:
have you had any experience with computer?

person beta:
yes, i studied in a computer training program, and can process data through the computer.

person alpha:
that's fine. what about operating the fax and duplicator?

person beta:
i can handle them without any trouble

person alpha:
what have you learned from jobs you have held?

person beta:
above all, i have learned that what is good for the company is good for me. so i follow the instructions strictly and always keep my boss informed.

person alpha:
very good.

person beta:
hi, dan. what's new?

person alpha:
where have you been? i've been trying to get in touch with you for two days.

person beta:
i went to salt lake city on business. what's up?

person alpha:
i got fired.

person beta:
how come? last time i saw you. you told me it was a good job, and you'd like to take it as a career. that was only one month ago. why this sudden change?

person alpha:
it's a long story. in a word, i didn't do a good job of it. i messed up a business deal, a deal that would have made ten million dollars and i messed it up.

person beta:
what are you going to do now?

person alpha:
i am trying to find a job asap. lily doesn't know yet. i didn't tell her. i spent the past three days at the coffee shop next to your office, and she thought i went to work as usual.

person beta:
that's not the way to solve the problem. did you look in the classified advertisements column?

person alpha:
yes, i did. but i wasn't qualified for most of the jobs that i was interested in.

person beta:
listen. i will see what i can do, ok? you go home and tell lily about this problem you have now. she is your wife and i am sure she will understand.

person alpha:
i just don't know how to bring it up. well, all right. she has the right to know anyways.

person beta:
have you ever gotten a parking ticket?

person alpha:
i've never gotten one. have you?

person beta:
i got a ticket yesterday.

person alpha:
really? what did you get one for?

person beta:
i parked in the red zone.

person alpha:
why did you do that?

person beta:
i needed to get something really quick.

person alpha:
where did you park at?

person beta:
at my apartment building.

person alpha:
don't you have your own parking spot?

person beta:
i needed to be fast.

person alpha:
that was very lazy of you.

person beta:
how may i help you?

person alpha:
i'm having a problem.

person beta:
what problem are you having?

person alpha:
there have been charges made on my debit card that i didn't make.

person beta:
do you have the statement for your card?

person alpha:
here it is.

person beta:
what are the charges you're referring to?

person alpha:
the last four charges on the page.

person beta:
i'm afraid we're going to have to investigate these charges.

person alpha:
how long will an investigation take?

person beta:
i honestly don't know, but we will freeze payment on these charges.

person alpha:
that sounds absolutely fantastic.

person beta:
good afternoon. can i be of service?

person alpha:
i don't know. can i purchase treasury certificates here at this counter?

person beta:
yes, of course. we have treasury notes with two, three and five-year terms available.

person alpha:
two years is fine, with a value of 1,000 rib.

person beta:
ok, could i take a look at some id please, like a passport?

person alpha:
here you go. by the way, is it possible to cash them before the maturity comes up?

person beta:
no, i'm afraid that isn't possible. you must wait until maturity before you cash them.

person alpha:
hey. why did you take that money? you are such a cheater! i should send you to jail!

person beta:
i am not cheating. when you pass go, you collect$ 200, everyone knows that!

person alpha:
well you can't just take the money. you have to ask the bank for money. and i'm the banker.

person beta:
banker?

person alpha:
yes...

person beta:
can i have my$ 200 please?

person alpha:
sure. here you are,$ 200, thank you, please come again! now it's my turn to roll the dice.

person beta:
hi, is this professor clark's office?

person alpha:
this is professor clark speaking.

person beta:
hi, this is kalina from your morning literature class.

person alpha:
yes, what can i do for you?

person beta:
i had a skydiving accident over the weekend and won't be able to come to school today.

person alpha:
my goodness! are you ok?

person beta:
i broke my leg, but it is healing.

person alpha:
how long will you be out of class?

person beta:
i should be able to return by next monday.

person alpha:
fine. well, thanks for calling and letting me know you will be absent. i hope you feel better soon.

person beta:
good afternoon! did you call for a plumber?

person alpha:
yes, yes i did. please come in! i'm so glad you came! this old house is falling apart! come on into the bathroom. see, here, there's water leaking everywhere!

person beta:
i see. let me have a look. it seems that your toilet is clogged, and that's why it won't flush. let me just get my plunger. no, that's not working either. i suspect that there's some sort of foreign object in the pipes that's causing a blockage. that's what's making your toilet overflow.

person alpha:
oh, that must be because of my four-year-old daughter. she is always flushing things down the toilet. you know how kids are.

person beta:
yeah, i have a little one myself. anyway, these water pipes are really rusty, so they also should be changed. thatcould be causing water to not drain completely, that might lead to more problems in the future. i would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn't shutting off properly. i could have it all finished by today if it's urgent.

person alpha:
that would be great! is it expensive?

person beta:
let's see... i would say about eight hundred dollars.

person alpha:
listen, karen, i need your help. i don't know anyone here yet.

person beta:
i'm glad to help you. what's wrong?

person alpha:
my mother-in-law just went into the hospital in l.a.hank and i will be flying there tonight.

person beta:
i'm sorry to hear it. what's wrong with her?

person alpha:
doctors aren't sure yet.but the real problem is suzy. she has a bad cold, and we don't want to take her with us. but we don't know who can stay with her.

person beta:
you need a babysitter.

person alpha:
yes, i'd ask jill, the girl i've had before, but i need someone overnight.maybe even for two nights.

person beta:
i could have suzy stay at my place.

person alpha:
i don't want to do that to you, karen.

person beta:
why not?

person alpha:
your own kids would get suzy's cold. i think it would be better to have a good babysitter here. but i don't know who to ask. i need someone more mature than jill. it might even be for two or three days.

person beta:
i know who we can ask. there is a girl i know, sara ralston.she is 17, and she will usually take this kind of job. i know her from my church, and i trust her completely.

person alpha:
i'd like to talk with her.this is short notice, i know. but hank and i are leaving tonight.

person beta:
i'll get you her number. i hope she can do it. she is very responsible.

person alpha:
i'm glad you know someone. i knew you would be the best person to ask about this. i don't want to insult jill or her mother. i think jill maybe could do it.but i'd rather have someone a little older.

person beta:
i'll go home and get sara's number. i'll call her first myself.

person alpha:
great. then call me and let me know if she's free.

person beta:
good evening. what'll you have?

person alpha:
i'd like a beer. what kind of beer do you have?

person beta:
draft beer and cans beer. which do you prefer?

person alpha:
a draft beer please.

person beta:
ok. here you are.

person alpha:
could i have some fruit?

person beta:
of course. wait for a moment, please.

person alpha:
hello, mr. black, how are you?

person beta:
fine, thank you, and how are you?

person alpha:
very well, thank you. it's nice to meet you again. i am awfully sorry for not being able to meet you at the airport, as i was busy yesterday. i do hope you had a very enjoyable trip from new york.

person beta:
yes, a very pleasant journey indeed. thank you.

person alpha:
how are you getting along with your business?

person beta:
not bad. the fur market is not very brisk lately, but the selling season is advancing near. i hope there will be more buyers in the market this year.

person alpha:
i hope we can do more business together. though we are satisfied with our past trade record, there are still possibilities for more business. in the meantime, let's discuss other spheres of cooperation, such as investment, technology transfer and technical assistance.

person beta:
by the way miss, where is the toilet?

person alpha:
toilets are in the rear, i am afraid all the toilets are fully occupied at the moment.

person beta:
what? oh, what we live! thank you very much for your help, miss.

person alpha:
you are welcome.

person beta:
excuse me, could you tell me which line i'm supposed to stand in to buy bubble wrap and to post a package?

person alpha:
you can buy the bubble wrap here, but you'll have to stand in line over here to post your passage.

person beta:
that's a really long line. how long do you think it'll take to get through all those people?

person alpha:
it takes about 3 minutes per person, so it'll probably be about an hour's wait.

person beta:
can i buy stamps here?

person alpha:
sure. how many would you like?

person beta:
i need 30 for my christmas cards.

person alpha:
are you sending them abroad?

person beta:
twenty of them are going abroad to china and america.

person alpha:
do you have any going anywhere in the eu? if you do, those are less expensive.

person beta:
no.

person alpha:
ok, here you go. that will be 18 pounds and seventy two pence.

person beta:
and the bubble wrap?

person alpha:
that's another quid.

person beta:
thanks a lot. you've been very helpful.

person alpha:
good evening, saliva. what's that wonderful aroma from your kitchen? what are you doing now?

person beta:
i am cooking now!

person alpha:
are you good at cooking?

person beta:
i have studied its skills recently at a training school. i plan to run a restaurant, so i have to practise cooking!

person alpha:
it is a good idea. what dish are you cooking now?!

person beta:
i am steaming fish in a pressure cooker. have you ever tried steamed fish?

person alpha:
yes, i have. but the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious. the fish is not well-done and too salty.

person beta:
that's the case. i think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much.

person alpha:
i have the same idea as yours.

person beta:
it's ok. please have a taste of it.

person alpha:
thank you. oh, it's very delicious.

person beta:
thank you for your praise.

person alpha:
besides steamed fish, what else are you good at cooking?

person beta:
i am good at stewing beef with potato, frying chicken, hot and sour soup etc.

person alpha:
so many dishes. next friday week is my birthday. i would like to invite you to cook for my dinner party, ok?

person beta:
why not? it is a good opportunity for me to practise cooking.

person alpha:
thanks a lot.

person beta:
it's my pleasure.

person alpha:
room service.what can i do for you?

person beta:
this is room 2012. where is my laundry? you promised to send to me this morning.

person alpha:
well, let me check for you. i am sorry, sir. they mistook your order as a normal one.actualty it's an express laundry, is that right?

person beta:
yes, i ordered the express service.

person alpha:
sir, we are terribly sorry for that.we will refund the charge and send your laundry to your room 3 hours later. is that all right?

person beta:
that's fine.

person alpha:
i'd like you to do me a favor.

person beta:
what is it?

person alpha:
can you mail this at the post office for me? i have to go to the doctor for an appointment and i don't have enough time to go to the post office.

person beta:
sure. and i'd like you to get some cold medicine for me when you go to the doctor's.

person alpha:
excuse me, may i help you?

person beta:
would you please fill some gas for me?

person alpha:
sure. which kind of gas do you want?

person beta:
unleaded, please.

person alpha:
ok.

person beta:
i'll be willing to come and talk about the financing of our imports.

person alpha:
it can be solved by drawing a draft on us at 90 days sight.

person beta:
what about a draft at 120 days sight?

person alpha:
all right. but we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us.

person beta:
a bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports. you can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due.

person alpha:
then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank. you know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible.

person beta:
i hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries.

person alpha:
so do i.

person beta:
there's a new girl in school, have you seen her yet?

person alpha:
i haven't seen her yet.

person beta:
i think that she is very pretty.

person alpha:
tell me how she looks.

person beta:
she's kind of short.

person alpha:
what height is she?

person beta:
she's probably about five feet.

person alpha:
that's nice, but tell me what she looks like.

person beta:
the first thing i noticed was her beautiful brown eyes.

person alpha:
i think i might've bumped into her before.

person beta:
are you telling me that you've seen her before?

person alpha:
i believe so.

person beta:
take a seat inside and see what you think.so you will take the porsche then, sir?

person alpha:
yes, and i want to buy the insurance too. i think it's necessary.

person beta:
you're smart to buy it. at 45 dollars for three days, it is a good deal.

person alpha:
can i return the car in san francisco?

person beta:
san francisco? no, sir.we only have this office here. you will have to return it here.

person alpha:
really? i heard in america you can return rental cars in different cities.

person beta:
no, sir. that's only with the very big companies. i'm sorry, but this car must be returned to this lot.

person alpha:
well, i guess i will have to drive back down then. hmm. i didn't think of that.

person beta:
do you still want the car, sir?

person alpha:
yes. it will be fun. driving back down the coast. my girlfriend will like it.

person beta:
it's a beautiful drive.

person alpha:
where are the keys?

person beta:
just a moment, sir. we have to finish filling out the forms.

person alpha:
gary. could you type up this report for me? i have to take off early this afternoon.

person beta:
sure. just leave it to me. i'll finish it.

person alpha:
look at the show on tv. i am watching a food show at a very famous seafood restaurant. i really want to eat at that restaurant. i am a seafood lover.

person beta:
speaking of seafood, my mouth is watering. let's go to the seafood restaurant in our neighborhood.

person alpha:
sound great. let's go!

person beta:
look at the crystal clear fridge. you can see so many kinds of seafood in it. they all look very fresh and delicious.

person alpha:
true. i would like to have some salmon sashimi and a roast salmon head.

person beta:
you sound like a seafood expert. i would like to have some stir-fried squids and steamed shrimps.

person alpha:
you are not too bad as well. i also want to have a steamed lobster. it is really taste like heaven.

person beta:
let's go into the restaurant and find a table to order some food.

person alpha:
wait. let me tell the lady what we would like to order in front of the seafood fridge first.

person beta:
ok. i will wait for you inside the restaurant

person alpha:
do you think we should try some deep fried oysters?

person beta:
where do you want to go?

person alpha:
i'm going to the hospital.

person beta:
get in. i'll take you.

person alpha:
about how much will it cost?

person beta:
it will cost you$ 10.

person alpha:
by the way, what's the time?

person beta:
you can see the time on the meter. i have radio time, you know.

person alpha:
it's a quarter to 12. could you please drive a little faster?

person beta:
certainly.

person alpha:
you're made a good choice. this china tea set is unusual.

person beta:
where was it from?

person alpha:
it was made in jingdezhen.

person beta:
jingdezhen? isn't it called'the capital of porcelain'?

person alpha:
you are right.

person beta:
this is the very thing i've been dreaming of.

person alpha:
it is the best quality porcelain-the famous egg-shell china.

person beta:
it must be most precious.

person alpha:
but it is really worth the price.

person beta:
hello, miao li, where are you going?

person alpha:
hello, i am going to the store to buy some fruit.

person beta:
oh, would you do me a favor?

person alpha:
yes?

person beta:
please mail this letter for me on your way to the store.

person alpha:
sure. do you want it to be registered?

person beta:
yes, i think so. there are some pictures in it. it would be a great pity if they were lost.

person alpha:
yes, i will be glad to mail your letter.

person beta:
thanks.

person alpha:
you are welcome.

person beta:
i have a cell phone in my car. now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.why don't you get it for me, and then i can call the police?

person alpha:
alright.

person beta:
it doesn't work. it looks like it's broken. i need to get to a hospital. you should drive me there.

person alpha:
oh, yeah? it's better if we make a police report first. then you can go to the hospital.

person beta:
damn it! i'm injured here. we could wait all day for the police.

person alpha:
well, you'll just have to wait. i'm not going to move my car until the police arrive. i'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone. don't worry. you'll get to the hospital in time.

person beta:
it really hurts.

person alpha:
yes, maybe it does.but if you're going to drive like you did just now, you will have to get used to a little physical pain. you know what i mean?

person beta:
to hell with you. the accident was your fault.

person alpha:
i'm afraid it wasn't. and when the police get here, you will also see that it wasn't. but enough of this bickering. i'm going to go find a phone.don't move that arm while i'm gone. alright?

person beta:
to hell with you.

person alpha:
good morning. vane theater, at your service.

person beta:
hello. i'm thinking about watching a chinese traditional opera with a foreign girl. what's on this weekend?

person alpha:
well, there will be charity performance on saturday night. and also, there will be a solo concert by an opera star on sunday night.

person beta:
it's a good thing that i have choices here. can you tell me about the one on saturday?

person alpha:
sure. it's to raise money for the homeless.

person beta:
what about the performance itself?

person alpha:
oh, it's a reserved opera named the monkey creates havoc in heaven.

person beta:
wow, a story about the clever monkey king. it's a classic and children's favorite.

person alpha:
it surely is. and the cast is really the best.

person beta:
wonderful! how much is the ticket?

person alpha:
the price varies according to the seats. 300 for the front, 200 for the middle, and 50 for the back.

person beta:
all right. i want to bring everybody back on this subject. when can we start working on this?

person alpha:
well, we could probably get started with a preparatory meeting this afternoon at 2:00.

person beta:
i tell you what, 2:00 is not available for me, but you can get started and i'll come by at around 3:00

person alpha:
that's fine with me. how much time are we going to have to work on this?

person beta:
perhaps one year, i'm not sure.

person alpha:
what dressing would you like on the salad?

person beta:
french dressing, please.

person alpha:
i beg your pardon?

person beta:
oh, french dressing.

person alpha:
sorry, it's not available now.anything else?

person beta:
we still prefer french dressing.

person alpha:
could i have some fish?

person beta:
certainly. and what vegetables would you like?

person alpha:
oh, spinach, i think.

person beta:
fine, and what about something to drink?

person alpha:
just a beer, please.

person beta:
good. thank you.sir.

person alpha:
would you like to have some more beer?

person beta:
no, thanks. i've had enough. i'll have my bill, please.

person alpha:
of course. please wait a moment. i'll go and get it.

person beta:
thank you.

person alpha:
hi, george. i'm going to have a job interview next week. could you give me some advice?

person beta:
sure. first of all, it's very important for you not to be late. job interviewers usually don't think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time, only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic.

person alpha:
yeah, that's very important.

person beta:
so you'd better explore the place the day before and at the same time, look around to see what the employees are wearing. so the next day you will arrive early for the appointment.

person alpha:
i'll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer.

person beta:
that's right. you need to create a good image in a limited time, usually about 30 to 45 minutes.

person alpha:
it's always easier to say something than to do it.

person beta:
it's not too difficult to make a good impression. for example, you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed. avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style. this will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications.

person alpha:
but i love wearing t-shirts and jeans.

person beta:
i advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview. informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job, or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes.

person alpha:
it's a pity that i cannot afford more expensive clothes.

person beta:
you misunderstood me. clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job, or that you are snobbish or frivolous.

person alpha:
i know what you mean. i ought to wear right clothes at the right time.

person beta:
you got it. only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement.

person alpha:
it seems that'clothes make the man'.

person beta:
it may not be true, but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior.

person alpha:
the boss announces the pay raise today, right? how much do you think we'll get?

person beta:
no idea. your guess is as good as mine.

person alpha:
it better be more than last year.

person beta:
well, anything is better than nothing. wait and see.

person alpha:
i'm sorry, our appointment has to be changed.

person beta:
what a pity!

person alpha:
if you don't mind, may we put it off to the next day?

person beta:
that's ok.

person alpha:
good day! welcome to lincoln bank, how may we assist you?

person beta:
hello. i need to find out if a receipt of proceeds has arrived. i'm from felix wasserman associates.

person alpha:
thanks. have you got the l/ c number?

person beta:
it's nx567822100007.

person alpha:
hang on a tick and i'll check for you. i'm sorry; we have no record of that arriving.

person beta:
ok, thanks for checking. could you give me a ring when it arrives, please?

person alpha:
no problem. i'll be in touch as soon as it comes in.

person beta:
may i help you?

person alpha:
yes. i have to stay in your cry for just one day, can you suggest a short tour?

person beta:
are you interested in the natural landscape or the human landscape?

person alpha:
i would prefer the first one.

person beta:
sure. we have a one-day trip along the river. it's quite beautiful.

person alpha:
hello, sir. how can we help you today?

person beta:
i need to find out some more information for l/ c. i would like an outline of responsibilities, both ours, yours and the beneficiary, please.

person alpha:
ok, to start, the conditions are specified by the buyer and may include insurance forms, way bills, bills of lading, customs forms, various certificates.

person beta:
ok, got it. is there anything else i need to know before we go ahead?

person alpha:
just that in effect, a basic letter of credit is a financial contract between the bank, the bank's customer, and the beneficiary, and this contract involves the transfer of goods or services against funds.

person beta:
that sounds fine, thanks for that. let's go ahead!

person alpha:
911 emergency. what is the problem?

person beta:
i would like to report a break-in.

person alpha:
when was this break-in?

person beta:
i believe it happened last night.

person alpha:
where was the break-in?

person beta:
it happened at my house.

person alpha:
was anything stolen?

person beta:
i haven't checked yet.

person alpha:
why do you think there was a break-in?

person beta:
my front window was broken.

person alpha:
we'll send a squad car shortly.

person beta:
i'd appreciate that.

person alpha:
excuse me. how much is the chocolate bar?

person beta:
one dollar.

person alpha:
so, i can have five for five dollars?

person beta:
actually, you can only have four.

person alpha:
oh, yeah. i forgot tax. give me four then, please.

person beta:
okay. thanks.

person alpha:
house keeping.may i come in?

person beta:
come in please.

person alpha:
good evening, sir. i come to make the bed. shall i do it now or later?

person beta:
well, since you have come, do it now please?

person alpha:
that's all. have a nice stay here.

person beta:
thank you.please get some soap for us.

person alpha:
just a moment. i will do it right now.

person beta:
ms. montgomery? this is richard thomas. i'm sorry to bother you at home, but i've got a bit of a problem.

person alpha:
oh? what's wrong?

person beta:
my daughter's just banged up her knee pretty badly and i'm going to have to take her to the hospital. i'll be about two hours late.

person alpha:
excuse me. i have an appointment with mr. li at nine. may i come in?

person beta:
yes, come in please. i am mr. li. you must be my liu, right?

person alpha:
yes, i am my liu. thanks.

person beta:
i'd like to start this interview with some questions. why do you think you are qualified for this position?

person alpha:
according to your advertisement, you want an experienced software engineer. i think my background meets the requirement of this position.

person beta:
then tell me something about your background.

person alpha:
my major was computer science when i was at college, and i am quite familiar with visual c++ and java language.

person beta:
well, what do you think about the development in computers?

person alpha:
the developments in software are going ahead very quickly and more and more problems are resolved by software. in some regions, the hardware is completely replaced by software. so i think the software industry has a great future.

person beta:
have you ever designed any programs concerning network?

person alpha:
yes, i have designed some programs for the network with visual c++ and i have passed the test for programmers- muse.

person beta:
have you got anything to ask me?

person alpha:
yes, can you tell me what's my responsibility in this position?

person beta:
yes, of course. you would be responsible for the development of software products.

person alpha:
i see. this is my advantage.

person beta:
good. have you got any other questions?

person alpha:
no.

person beta:
ok, i will contact you in a week. see you.

person alpha:
thank you, bye-bye.

person beta:
tom, is jenny crying?

person alpha:
can you take he away from me?

person beta:
i'm just coming for that.

person alpha:
she kept bothering me.

person beta:
she's your sister. what she asked was only duck soup for you. why can't you be good to her?

person alpha:
but i am her brother, not her servant.

person beta:
hello, where can i buy an inexpensive cashmere sweater?

person alpha:
maybe you should look around for an outlet.

person beta:
that is a wonderful idea.

person alpha:
outlets have more reasonable prices.

person beta:
thank you for your help.

person alpha:
no problem. good luck

person beta:
wow! your fruit looks really fresh! how much are these apples?

person alpha:
the apples are 30nt each. how many would you like?

person beta:
let's see, 30nt is about... almost a dollar us. what?! how about these pineapples?

person alpha:
they're 250nt each, but they're not edible. they're only used for worship.

person beta:
hmm, 250nt is... 8 dollars?!! and you can't even eat them? you're crazy!

person alpha:
wait! don't go just yet. these bananas are pretty cheap--only 35nt for this bunch.

person beta:
now that's more like it! bananas have lots of potassium, too!

person alpha:
they're also good for your digestion! would you like some kiwis, too?

person beta:
are they from taiwan?

person alpha:
they're imported from new zealand. four for 50nt. nine for a hundred.

person beta:
ok. i'll take four kiwis.

person alpha:
amelia, could you spare a few minutes?

person beta:
sure. what do you need?

person alpha:
well, i wanted to let you know that i've put in my notice.

person beta:
really? why?

person alpha:
it's complicated. but basically it boils down to one thing. this company is downsizing and i can't continue working for a company that may let me go.

person beta:
but surely they won't fire you! you're one of the most experienced managers here!

person alpha:
well, to be honest, there's another reason. i've got a better offer.

person beta:
well that's great news! congratulations! where will you be located?

person alpha:
the head office is in new york, but i'll be dealing with overseas companies and flying to this side of the world from time to time.

person beta:
it'll be sad to see you go, but it sounds like you're found yourself a great opportunity.

person alpha:
i have. i feel lucky. i look forward to dealing with overseas companies and at the same time having a chance to use english more.

person beta:
i'm sorry to bring this up, but would it be possible for you to write me a letter of recommendation before you go?

person alpha:
of course i can. in fact, if there are other job opportunities at this new company, i'll recommend you personally.

person beta:
thanks. i appreciate that.

person alpha:
what can i show you?

person beta:
do you have this shirt in a small?

person alpha:
let me check. yes, we have.

person beta:
may i try it on?

person alpha:
sure. let me help you.

person beta:
the james's file, christine?

person alpha:
i had it right here a minute ago, mr. emory. umm. just a minute...

person beta:
christine, i know you're new here and there's a lot to learn, but you are going to have to learn to keep your work in better order. we can't afford to lose an important document.

person alpha:
yes, sir. i apologize for that. here's the file you were looking for, mr. emory.

person beta:
i wonder whether i could possibly borrow your new bicycle now.

person alpha:
sorry, i'm using it myself.but you can use it this afternoon.

person beta:
thank you very much.

person alpha:
thanks for inviting me to work out with you, joan.

person beta:
don't mention it, let's go in.

person alpha:
yeah, this place looks great. wow, look at her, she can certainly get down, can't she?

person beta:
she sure can. are you jealous, leslie?

person alpha:
a little, i wish i could do that.

person beta:
you can! with a little practice.

person alpha:
look at him, he's buff.

person beta:
i think he's hot too.

person alpha:
how do they all get in such tiptop shape?

person beta:
exercised over and over. exercise is a key.

person alpha:
that's it. i decided to turn over a new leaf. i'm going to exercise every single day.

person beta:
good for you, leslie!

person alpha:
excuse me. check please.

person beta:
ok, how was everything?

person alpha:
very nice. thank you.

person beta:
would you like this to-go?

person alpha:
yes, can you put it in a plastic bag?

person beta:
sure, no problem. here you are. that'll be 25 dollars.

person alpha:
do you take credit cards?

person beta:
yes, we accept visa and mastercard.

person alpha:
ok, here you are.

person beta:
thanks. i'll be right back.

person alpha:
ok.

person beta:
here's your receipt.

person alpha:
thank you.

person beta:
you're welcome. please come again.

person alpha:
you look upset, anything wrong?

person beta:
i'm going to quit the job.

person alpha:
why?

person beta:
the task is tough.

person alpha:
you'd look before you leap.

person beta:
thanks for your concern.

person alpha:
how long will you stay in new york?

person beta:
just tor three days. i won't need these luggages.couid i put them here?

person alpha:
i am sorry. if you have here more than 24 hours between connecting flights, we can't check your luggage through london.

person beta:
well, maybe i can put them in the airport storage there.

person alpha:
that's right. it's over there.

person beta:
eat some more.

person alpha:
no, thanks. i'm on a diet.

person beta:
excuse me. do you know where the admiral hotel is?

person alpha:
that's over on callaway street, isn't it?

person beta:
yes, but i can't find callaway street.

person alpha:
walk that way for about four blocks. the hotel's about two blocks north of there.

person beta:
thanks a lot.

person alpha:
not at all.

person beta:
i'm sorry i'm late.

person alpha:
better late than never.

person beta:
professor li, do you know where to buy art supplies?

person alpha:
for what? are you taking up painting?

person beta:
no. i can't paint. i'm asking for my niece. she is really into it.

person alpha:
oh, good. how old is your niece?

person beta:
she is eight. actually, i'm buying a good set of art supplies for her as a birthday gift.

person alpha:
it's a wise thing to do. art will do a child a world of good.

person beta:
hello?

person alpha:
hi, mr. smith. this is mary. is jenny there?

person beta:
no, i'm afraid not, mary. may i take a message for her?

american food would be the best choice.

person alpha:
but there are only two more days until the bidding closes!

person beta:
i bid on a chanel watch at the last minute, and got it sixty percent off!

person alpha:
oh... i'm such a newbie. but at least i'm sure i'll get that tennis racket.

person beta:

person alpha:
well... guess how low the bidding starts on the tennis racket?

person beta:

person alpha:
yes, i wanted to look for some information on the company page just now. it took me almost one minute to open it. then there is no response to any click.

person beta:
i have the same question. i can't send out mails. we'd better call the it department and ask them to check it immediately.

person alpha:
ok.

person beta:
honey, i need to have a talk with you.

person alpha:
dad, i have to do my homework.

person beta:
no, honey, why didn't you go to cram school last night?

person alpha:
dad, i don't want to talk about it now.

person beta:
honey, if you don't want to go to cram school, you should tell me the reason why.

person beta:
i want to get some pie.

person beta:
i have no idea.

person alpha:

person alpha:

person beta:
i want to see the man responsible for selling typewriters.

person alpha:

person beta:
well, look here. ten new typewriters were delivered to my company yesterday afternoon and only five of them work properly.

person alpha:
oh, i'm sorry about that.

person beta:

person alpha:
don't worry, we'll soon fix them.

person beta:
good, i hope you'll make sure that it won't happen again.

i'm looking for a string of pearls for my wife.

i'm not sure. i don't know very much about the price of pearls.

person beta:
i see. let me show you some samples of various qualities. this one is very nice. it's three hundred and fifty dollars.

person alpha:
is there a price reduction?

person beta:
we are having a sale now. the price has already gone down.

person alpha:
how much is that one?

person beta:
it's two hundred and eighty dollars.

person alpha:
ok. i'll take it. thank you.

person beta:
can i help you?

person alpha:
yes, i would like to buy a walkman. can you tell me about the models you have?

person beta:
well, we have a lot of models here.did you want to listen to cd's or cassettes or the radio?

person alpha:
mostly cassette tapes.

person beta:
alright. there are several models you may want to look at.this kreng portable cassette player is very good.

person alpha:
kreng? i've never heard of that company.

person beta:
it's a german company.this unit has auto-reverse, recording capability, and an am/ fm radio band.it also has a built-in microphone.

person alpha:
i suppose i don't want that one then. i don't like auto-reverse. it breaks too easily.

person beta:
really? have you had an auto-reverse break before?

person alpha:
yes, twice now. i think it's too high-tech, and so it's the first part that breaks.

person beta:
hmm. you know, the problem might be dust. did you clean the unit often?

person alpha:
well. no, i didn't clean it.but still, i only had the last one two months, and it broke. i don't trust auto-reverse.

person beta:
alright. well. we have many units without auto-reverse.here is a good unit. very reliable.it has an am/ fm band, built-in microphone, recording capability, and no auto-reverse.

person alpha:
how much is it?

person beta:
this one sells for$ 39.99.

person alpha:
can i test it out?

person beta:
of course.

person alpha:
it sounds great. i'll take it.

person beta:
fine. i think you'll be happy with it. it's a very good unit. very reliable. i'll go get you a new one in a box. i will be back in just a moment.

person alpha:
thanks.

person beta:
tell me about yourself.

person alpha:
i was born and raised in beijing. i attended peking university and received my bachelor's degree in economics. i have worked for 2 years as a financial consultant in beijing for china pacific insurance co. ltd.

person beta:
what type of position are you looking for?

person alpha:
i'm looking for a position in which i can utilize my experience.

person beta:
are you interested in a full-time or part-time position?

person alpha:
i am more interested in a full-time position. however, i would also consider a part-time position.

person beta:
can you tell me about your responsibilities at your last job?

person alpha:
i advised customers on financial matters. after i consulted the customer, i completed a customer inquiry form and catalogued the information in our database. i then collaborated with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client. the clients were then presented with a summarized report on their financial activities that i formulated on a quarterly basis.

person beta:
what is your greatest strength?

person alpha:
i am an excellent communicator. people trust me and come to me for advice. one afternoon, my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well. i made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together.

person beta:
what is your greatest weakness?

person alpha:
i tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied. however, i began setting time-limits for myself.

person beta:
why do you want to work for our company?

person alpha:
after following your firm's progress for the last 3 years, i am convinced that your company is becoming one of the market leaders and i would like to be a part of that team.

person beta:
when can you begin?

person alpha:
immediately.

person beta:
please tell me how to file things according to the concerned rules.

person alpha:
well, all right. there are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents, information and other things.

person beta:
what are they?

person alpha:
they are keep the documents in chronological order, remove all the chips and pins, punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder.

person beta:
and what is the most important point?

person alpha:
you should always remember that one customer one file is the rule.

person beta:
yeah, look at all those new buildings going up! mr. zhang, the traffic is pretty smooth. but we were told the roads from the airport to downtown were quite crowded and traffic jams could be as long as half an hour.

person alpha:
yes, they were. but it has already past. the traffic from the airport to downtown has been relieved after the completion of yan'an aerial road.

person beta:
we've never expected that shanghai is such a big metropolis, same as new york city. david, would it be a good idea to rent a car here? i've got an international driver's license with a pretty good record in the states.

person alpha:
that's wonderful. ok. i'll remember that. but i have to warn you that you must drive very carefully in the downtown area, for there're no separate lanes for motor vehicles and bicycles in some places, and still quite a few people don't take road regulations seriously.

person beta:
this house is not looking all that great from here

person alpha:
you can't really tell everything about a house from the outside. let's go inside.

person beta:
i don't think that it is looking any better inside here.

person alpha:
i think that fresh paint and cleaning would help it look a little better.

person beta:
it is just too dark in here with so few windows.

person alpha:
i hear that the kitchen is quite large. let's go check it out.

person beta:
the kitchen may be large, but it doesn't have any storage space.

person alpha:
the master suite is supposed to be quite elegant. maybe it will be a little better.

person beta:
how many dogs live in this house?

person alpha:
i think that we have seen all that we need to see here. let's go look at another house.

person beta:
excuse me, waiter, i would like to have some wine before the main course.

person alpha:
have you decided what wine you would like?

person beta:
i have no idea. maybe you can give me some advice.

person alpha:
i recommend you the white wine. it will wake up your appetite.

person beta:
that's great, bring me a bottle of that please.

person alpha:
come on! it's time to go!

person beta:
wait a minute! just hold your horses! what's your hurry, anyway?

person alpha:
well, i've got to stop and get gas in the car, first.

person beta:
that won't take long.

person alpha:
well, it won't if there no line at the pump.

person beta:
well, i'm not quite ready.

person alpha:
i'll give you five more minutes, then i'm going on without you!

person beta:
you wouldn't do a thing like that!

person alpha:
oh, yes, i would!

person beta:
i wonder if i can see your mother, little boy. is she engaged?

person alpha:
engaged? she's married.

person beta:
johnny, i wish you'd stop reaching for things. haven't you a tongue?

person alpha:
yes, mother, but my arm is longer.

person beta:
hello! tomorrow i'm going to need a wake-up call.

person alpha:
not a problem. what time shall we call you?

person beta:
i always hit the snooze button, so give me two calls, one at 7 and another at 7 fifteen.

person alpha:
it'll be our pleasure. we'll call you at 7 and then at 7 fifteen.

person beta:
oops, cancel that. change the second call to 7 thirty will you, please?

person alpha:
no sooner said than done. can i help you with anything else?

person beta:
no, that's about it for now. thanks.

person alpha:
okay, sir. have a pleasant evening.

person beta:
have you seen our new packing specifications?

person alpha:
yes, i have, mr. thomas. we'll pack them two dozen to one carton, and the gross weight is around 25 kilos a carton.

person beta:
i'm really in a flap about the interview.

person alpha:
take it easy.you've made enough preparations.

person beta:
i'm in such a need of the job that i can't afford any mistakes.

person alpha:
i'm sure you'll pass it.

person beta:
do you think my briefcase is big enough to put in all these stuff?

person alpha:
let me see. laptop, flash disk, a ballpoint pen, a pencil, a notebook, a pair of glasses, cell phone, charger, moisture lotion,... oh, that is too much. you are not going to a business trip.

person beta:
i guess i need all of them.

person alpha:
actually, the company will provide you with all of these supplies. so, you can leave this very thick notebook at home.

person beta:
i know. but it is my lucky charm. i carry it all the time.

person alpha:
suit yourself. don't forget to set the alarm clock.

person beta:
may i know where you are going?

person alpha:
yes. i want to go to beijing hotel.

person beta:
i'm sorry. you are going in the wrong direction.

person alpha:
oh no! what shall i do?

person beta:
don't worry. you can get off at the next stop and go across the street through the overpass. the bus stop is right there.

person alpha:
thank you very much.

person beta:
my pleasure.

person alpha:
steven, shall we go shopping tomorrow?

person beta:
hum... why not go shopping the day after tomorrow? tomorrow is saturday. i hate all the hustle and bustle of saturday shopping.

person alpha:
but sunday is the same with saturday. if you don't mind, that's ok.

person beta:
hum.maybe it will be better. the most important thing is that i can have a day to relax after a week's work.

person alpha:
i see. we will go the day after tomorrow.

person beta:
by the way, what kind of stores do we need to go?

person alpha:
i want to buy some clothes in clothing store. when we are going back, go to the butcher's shop and buy some chicken.

person beta:
let's also go to the jewelry store to buy a crystal necklace. i want to buy one for you as your birthday present.

person alpha:
thank you, darling.

person beta:
have you seen the tower in front of us. that's the famous eiffel tower. it was built in 1889 for the world's fair.

person alpha:
how tall is this building?

person beta:
it stands 320m( 1050ft) high and held the record as the world's tallest structure until 1930.

person alpha:
i have heard its name is connected with someone, is that right?

person beta:
yes, the towel was named after its designer gustave eiffel.

person alpha:

person beta:

person beta:
no, thanks. i'm all set. good-bye.

person alpha:

person beta:
yeah. this is supply. what can i do for you?

person alpha:
this is rachel in human resources. i need two boxes of company letterhead, one box of ball-point pens, and a box of envelopes.

person beta:
all right. no problem. what's your extension?

person alpha:
john, i'd like you to meet charles brown, our new manager at the airport.

person beta:
yes, certainly. how can i recognize him?

person alpha:
he is short, well-built, and he's got light blond hair.

person beta:

person alpha:
he has a mustache, if i remember correctly, and a light complexion.

he is in his late thirties.

person beta:

what kind of soda would you like?

person alpha:
may i have a sprite, please?

person beta:

person alpha:
i would also like a bag of chips.

person beta:
will that be all?

person alpha:
that's everything.

person beta:
please tell me something about your insurance background.

person alpha:
i majored in international banking at college so i took many insurance courses. and i worked at an insurance company for my graduation field work.

person beta:
why do you want to be an insurance agent?

person alpha:
i care about people and i know the importance of insurance.

person beta:
do you have any work experience in promotion?

person alpha:
yes, i do. i have worked as a salesman for p& g company ltd.

person beta:
do people respond well to you?

person alpha:
yes, i'm good with people.

person beta:
ah, here we are.

person alpha:
this is the place i was telling you about.

person beta:
would you like to sit near the window?

person alpha:
good.

person beta:
let's have a look at the menu. oh, there isn't a menu. do you think you could ask the people at the next table if we could look at their menu?

person alpha:
yes, of course. excuse me. could you possibly let us see your menu? oh. they haven't got one either.

person beta:
are you going to buy a bicycle?

person alpha:
i'm thinking about it. how much is it?

person beta:
y= 350.

person alpha:
oh, dear. it's too expensive. can you give me a better price?

person beta:
your discount is already included. normally we charge y= 400, but now we can give you a special price. this is our sale period.

person alpha:
it's still too much. can't you make it any cheaper than that?

person beta:
sorry, but this is the best price. you can't get it any cheaper than here.

person alpha:
i see. can i pay by traveler's checks?

person beta:
i'm afraid you can't. you're welcome to pay in cash.

person alpha:
do you have a free moment?

person beta:
sure. what do you need?

person alpha:
i'm having some trouble. how do you use this printer?

person beta:
well, first you have to turn this switch on.

person alpha:
silly me.

person beta:
now press this button.

person alpha:
oh, and it's out of paper. do you have any more?

person beta:
just a second. i'll go get some.

person alpha:
i need help using the washer and dryer.

person beta:
tell me what the problem is.

person alpha:
i can't figure out how to turn them on.

person beta:
do you have some quarters?

person alpha:
i didn't know i needed change.

person beta:
the washer costs 50 cents and the dryer costs a dollar.

person alpha:
where do i put the change?

person beta:
the quarters go into the slot. you have to push the slot in, and the machine will turn on.

person alpha:
is that everything that i have to do?

person beta:
that's all there is.

person alpha:
i appreciate you helping me with this.

person beta:
if you need anything else, just let me know.

person alpha:
do you have any questions?

person beta:
yes, do i have to work a whole year before i can take a vacation?

person alpha:
yes, after you've been here a year, you qualify for a three-day vacation

person beta:
only three days?

person alpha:
that's the company policy.

person beta:
what happens if i use up my sick days before the end of the year? if i'm sick an extra day or two, will my pay be deducted?

person alpha:
yes. that's the company policy.

person beta:
it was the same as the last place i worked at. i was hoping you'd be different.

person alpha:
i am absolutely famished.

person beta:
yeah. i am too.

person alpha:
where did you want to go for lunch?

person beta:
i was thinking we should just go to the cafeteria.

person alpha:
i don't think i ever got food from the cafeteria.

person beta:
i actually like the food there.

person alpha:
does the cafeteria sell a lot of different food?

person beta:
they have anything you want.

person alpha:
i was thinking about getting some chinese food.

person beta:
i bought some chow mein at the cafeteria. it tasted great.

person alpha:
we can eat at the cafeteria.

person beta:
i think you'll really like the food there.

person alpha:
here is the draft contract, mr. brown. let's discuss the clauses to see if we agree on all of them. then i will make out an original of the contract. after that, what's left is to fill out the contract and sign our names.

person beta:
that's ok.

person alpha:
the contract is to be written in chinese and english. both languages are equally effective.

person beta:
fine. if you'll excuse me, i'd like to go it over first.( after about 15 minutes) hmm, you've done a pretty good job. it's well prepared.

person alpha:
thank you.

person beta:
well, i suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time.

person alpha:
that's a good idea.

person beta:
first, let's read clause two about packing. it's our usual practice to ship our products in containers. that'll save time and money, but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases. so, we'd like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract.

person alpha:
agreed.

person beta:
for shipment, you know we are producing a complete set of equipment for you and it won't all be finished at one time. so would you allow us to make partial shipments.

person alpha:
i understand your position.

person beta:
i want to buy a black suit.

person alpha:
certainty.do you want double breasted suit or single breasted suit?

person beta:
i prefer single breasted suit.

person alpha:
what about this one? it's a very nice 3- piece suit.

person beta:
that looks great. do you have ties here?

person alpha:
how do you do? nice to meet you, diane.

person beta:
how do you do, jack. nice to meet you.

person alpha:
well, i think you've reconsidered our proposal, diane.

person beta:
yes, you are right. after all, the quality of your air conditioners is good. the only problem is price.

person alpha:
i should not be surprised, many customers have the same opinion. do you have any suggestion in mind? our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable.

person beta:
that's why i came to your office today. we think for your model we- 506$ 590 would be reasonable, because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579-649.

person alpha:
that's true. but if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product, you'll agree that 679 is not high, especially when we allow you a 10% discount.

person beta:
i see your point. that's to say s 611 each set. still it's much higher than the market price. could you see your way to reduce the price, jack?

person alpha:
well, considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to 600. that's the best we can do. what do you think of that?

person beta:
all right. we accept it. so$ 600 for each set.

person alpha:
very well. thank you.

person beta:
don't i know you?

person alpha:
i'm not sure.you look familiar.

person beta:
you're mr.stevenson, right?

person alpha:
yes.and you're mr.jones, i remember.

person beta:
that's all the general information of our company. i think you already have good knowledge about our company.

person alpha:
yes, i have an overall understanding.

person beta:
when we have the final results, we will call you.

person alpha:
then when will i get a reply at the latest?

person beta:
if you pass the interview, the personnel department will inform you within two weeks.

person alpha:
but if i don't pass, will you call me?

person beta:
i'm sorry we won't. you can wait for two weeks. if you don't get a telephone call, it means that you weren't successful.

person alpha:
then do i have the chance to get this job?

person beta:
i'm sorry but i can't make the final decision myself, and i have to discuss it with other interviewers.

person alpha:
i know. no matter what the result will be, i have learned a lot from our conversation.

person beta:
your mentality is very good and that's great.

person alpha:
thanks for giving me the opportunity of this interview.

person beta:
my pleasure.

person alpha:
i have a stomachache.

person beta:
well, you'd better lie down now. you need a good rest.

person alpha:
all right. i'll do that.

person beta:
what kind of personality do you think you have?

person alpha:
i'm quite active and energetic. i approach things enthusiastically and i don't like to leave things half-done.

person beta:
do you think you are introverted or extroverted?

person alpha:
i'm quite outgoing i think. i enjoy mixing and doing things with others.

person beta:
what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy?

person alpha:
i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends. a person can't live all by himself i think. a friend in need is a friend in deed.the more really close friends i have, the better.

person beta:
what kind of people do you like to work with?

person alpha:
people who are honest, dedicated to their work and having integrity.

person beta:
i would like to take this opportunity to welcome monica to our company and introduce her to her department and colleagues. for all of you, we hired monica because she is a very professional accountant and we are very happy to have her in the finance department. she has lots of working experiences as an accountant and i am sure everybody in the department can benefit from this.

person alpha:
hello, everybody. i am monica and this is my first day at work. i am working in the finance department. i am very happy to meet everyone and i am looking forward to working well with all of you. i am very happy to be one of the team and i will do my best to get into the working situation as soon as possible. by the way, call me monica. everybody calls me so.

person beta:
were you in a leadership position when you were a college student?

person alpha:
yes. i was president of the student council of our university.

person beta:
did you get any honors or awards at your university?

person alpha:
yes. i was elected excellent party member for four academic years.

person beta:
were you involved in any club activities at your university?

person alpha:
yes. i was a member of the student poetry society. i like writing poems in my spare time.

person beta:
what extracurricular activities did you usually take part in at your college?

person alpha:
i sometimes played table tennis and sometimes played basketball.

person beta:
margaret, i'd like to follow up with the arrangements for our company retreat, to take place next month. we need to book the venue, make arrangements for speakers and door prizes, and set up all the activities and accommodations. also, very important, we need to determine which of our staff will be eligible and will be available to go. we've got to get a head count in order to make reservations.

person alpha:
what's the criteria for staff to attend? are we only including our management team in this affair? or will we be extending invitations to lower level employees to attend?

person beta:
lower level employees need not attend. the purpose of this retreat is for training, especially for our management team. we want to develop a well-oiled machine on our executive level. in order to get everyone to jell together, we've got to include some fun. that's the reason for the retreat.

person alpha:
i think yoga might be suitable for me.

person beta:
why?

person alpha:
because it doesn't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up.

person beta:
but i see people sweat a lot doing yoga too.

person alpha:
i don't know. i just need to try it once. i'm in urgent need of some exercise to lose some weight.

person beta:
you should try swimming then. it helps you to keep fit.

person alpha:
we are looking for a bilingual secretary. do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken english?

person beta:
i think my english is fairly good. as you can see from my cv, i graduated from university with a b. a. degree in english. i studied the english language and english literature systematically.

person alpha:
how are your typing and shorthand skills?

person beta:
i can type 80 words a minute, basically no mistake, and can take dictation in english at 120 words per minute.

person alpha:
are these the clothes you want to have washed?

person beta:
yes. when can i get them back?

person alpha:
well, if they are collected right now, you can get them back tonight.

person beta:
that's fine. by the way, please have that suit dry cleaned.

person alpha:
ok. please fill in the form first.

person beta:
what's the matter with me, doctor? i feel so tired these days.

person alpha:
is your blood pressure, i'm afraid. it's far too high.

person beta:
and what's the cause of that?

person alpha:
overwork-amongst other things. you can't work 24 hours a day. you've got to slow down.

person beta:
but i can't just slow down.

person alpha:
you've got to, i'm afraid. and look at this. you weigh 200 stones. that's too much for a man of your size.

person beta:
you mean i've got to lose weight?

person alpha:
yes. you've got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise.

person beta:
you are an early bird, tom. what do you do in the morning then?

person alpha:
exercise. the morning hours are the most precious period within a single day. we should not pass them up easily. seize the time and do something useful.

person beta:
so, you choose to spend it on bodybuilding. where do you exercise?

person alpha:
usually, i run to the black bamboo park as a warm-up. admission is free. then i start my activities.

person beta:
do you do the same exercises every day?

person alpha:
no, i've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises; parallel bars, push-ups, sit-ups, bunny-hops, five-kilometer run, and so on. i alternate them over the weekdays. sometimes, when i find myself in a bad state, i will simply idle about in the park.

person beta:
why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising?

person alpha:
it's not easy to keep a good habit, you know. i fear that if i fail to get up early one day, i may find it still more difficult to rise early the next. besides, a mere walk in the early morning is much fun, too. here and there in the park, you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs, playing er'hu, chess, or just chatting and gossiping. it's interesting to join them.

person beta:
oh, yes. singing is also a good way of keeping fit, at least mentally.

person alpha:
i want some cosmetics.could you recommend some?

person beta:
i think pond's is the best.

person alpha:
and they're very dear, too.

person beta:
they're on special offer today.

person alpha:
oh, that's ideal.

person beta:
steven, i'm going abroad by plane for the first time tomorrow. can you give me some advice? and what should i pay attention to?

person alpha:
first, you should have enough sleep to get over the jet lag before the departure. most people will suffer from jet lag for a few days after a long flight.

person beta:
i will go to bed early tonight.

person alpha:
do you have an airsickness?

person beta:
i don't know. but i have a carsickness.

person alpha:
you'd better bring some medicine for airsickness.

person beta:
thank you.

person alpha:
can we choose a time to look at houses together?

person beta:
can you do that in the mornings, or would the afternoons be best?

person alpha:
either way is good for me.

person beta:
there are a number of open houses this weekend in your area. would that okay with you?

person alpha:
i can take a little time off of work, or i can go on a weekend, also.

person beta:
we could meet at the real estate office, or i could pick you up at your home.

person alpha:
i am leaving from work, so maybe i could just meet you at the first house that we will look at.

person beta:
i can think of five houses that we should look at. it will take most of the day.

person alpha:
i would like to see as many as possible.

person beta:
when i have confirmed the times with the owners, i will e-mail you our plans for the day.

person alpha:
do you have a package tour to hollywood?

person beta:
yes, here is the table, which plans do you like best?

person alpha:
the seven-days trip shall be fine. how much is this tour?

person beta:
$ 300.

person alpha:
we will take the trip. could you give us a pamphlet?

person beta:
here you are.

person alpha:
what's the problem? things are getting out of hand. you keep sticking your nose where it doesn't belong.

person beta:
what do you mean?

person alpha:
now, i am responsible for training new staff, but you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods. i know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove. but i don't like your way.

person beta:
mom, when you come home, please buy a coat, a skirt, a sweater...

person alpha:
enough is enough. i know.

person beta:
mr.chen, do you mind if i smoke?

person alpha:
i'm sorry, mrs. lin. we don't allow smoking in the office.

person beta:
good morning, can i help you?

person alpha:

person alpha:
hop in, please.

person beta:
is it a long ride to beijing library?

person alpha:
it will take about thirty minutes because it is the rush hour.

person beta:
thirty minutes, that will be all right. there are still fifty minutes to go before the library is open. look, what are they doing on the square?

person alpha:
it is an exhibition of chinese jades. it is held each year. a nice collection jades of are on display and sold.

person beta:

person beta:
i would like to buy a black suit.

person alpha:
do you have any special brand in your mind?

person beta:
no, i never wear suit in my everyday life. i just want one to take part in my sister's wedding ceremony.

person alpha:
i see. have a look at this one. it's very cheap because it's not very durable.

person beta:
but it looks good. let me try it on.

person alpha:
ok, the mirror is over there.

person beta:
what can i do for you, miss?

person alpha:
i am looking for a pair of shoes.

person beta:
do you like high heels or flat shoes?

person alpha:
high hells, please. i want to wear them in formal situations.

person beta:
hi jim. do you have a minute?

person alpha:
sure, what's up?

person beta:
some of us are going to start a soccer team. would you like to join us?

person alpha:
i don't know anything about it. soccer isn't as popular in my country as it is here.

person beta:
that's all right. we'll teach you.

person alpha:
is it anything like american football?

person beta:
not very much. it's something like hockey, except that you use a big ball and no stick.

person alpha:
i'll come down and watch you play some day, and see what it's like.

person beta:
good idea. i think you'll like it if you give it a chance.

person alpha:
do you remember what the ratings of movies stand for?

person beta:
yes, g stands for general audiences, pg means parental guidance suggested, r is restricted to audiences under 18 and x means explicit content.

person alpha:
does anyone pay any attention to those ratings anymore?

person beta:
remember when we were kids? theaters wouldn't let kids in to pg moves without a parent.

person alpha:
i remember that i never saw an x moves even displayed.

person beta:
now with video rentals it's all a personal matter.

person alpha:
yea, i never see theaters turn people away for their age anymore either.

person beta:
now we have to make a choice about what we will see and what we won't.

person alpha:
why aren't you doing well in the class?

person beta:
the material is so abstract that i have trouble understanding it.

person alpha:
reservation, can i help you?

person beta:
yes, i would like to reserve a room for next monday.

person alpha:
wait a moment, please. let me check it.

person beta:
by the way, i want a large room.

person alpha:
right now we have a suite for 4 people, do you want to book it?

person beta:
yes, that's what i am looking for. i will take the room for 2 days.

person alpha:
hey mel! are you up for some tennis today?

person beta:
sorry, i can't! i have to go to work, pick up jake and maddie from school, and make them an afternoon snack, then take jake to soccer practice and maddie to dance class.

person alpha:
you sound exhausted. maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out! she can pick the kids up and take them to their after-school activities. she can also help you do some household chores, and run so

person beta:
oh, i don't know... it's hard to find the right nanny. you have to consider her previous work experience, the responsibilities you give her, and how she interacts with the kids. i would love to have

person alpha:
i think you should definitely consider it! this way you won't have to juggle such a busy schedule, and you'll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings. i can refer you this great

person beta:
oh, that's great. thanks grace. can you give me her number? i'll talk it over with dan and give her a call tomorrow. maybe this way i won't be so tired every day, and dan and i might even get to go

person alpha:
can you tell that i'm excited?

person beta:
what are you excited about?

person alpha:
i voted today.

person beta:
was this your first time?

person alpha:
i just turned 18 a month ago.

person beta:
you're lucky.

person alpha:
what do you mean?

person beta:
because you turned 18 in an election year.

person alpha:
i didn't even think of that.

person beta:
you didn't?

person alpha:
i really didn't, but i'm still excited.

person beta:
you should be, because you're a part of history.

person alpha:
can i help you?

person beta:
yes. i want to buy a pair of shoes.

person alpha:
have you a pattern in your mind?

person beta:
well, maybe sneakers or rubber shoes.

person beta:
yeah, but what kit lens does this camera come with? i don't want some bulky telephoto lens.

person alpha:
oh, well this one has the, uh.

person alpha:
so, ahem, can i interest you in any acc...

person beta:
accessories? do you carry polarizing filters?

person alpha:
thank you. you've been very helpful.

person beta:
mr. crandall, i'm sorry, but i really don't see the value in doing this entire project over from scratch. it would take a lot of work.

person alpha:
that's certainly true. but, that's what this job is all about, maria. there's no doubt that this project is unacceptable.

person beta:
i agree. but i think that we can handle the problem by making a few major changes. i'd appreciate it if you would give me a chance.

person alpha:
all right, maria. i'll give you until tomorrow at 4:00 to produce a satisfactory piece of work, but otherwise, you'll have to re-do it.

i think it's time for me to meet my admirer and make him face the music.

person alpha:
you do? how are you going to contact him?

person beta:
i'm leaving him a message taped to my computer screen.

excuse me, does this bus go to the new bookstore?

person beta:
no, you'll have to get off at the bank, and take a no. 50.

person alpha:
thank you.how much is the fare to that stop?

person beta:
one dollar.

person alpha:
how many stops are there?

person beta:
two stops after this one.

person alpha:
could you please tell me when we get there?

person beta:
sure.

person alpha:
by the way, do i need a transfer again after no. 50?

person beta:
no, a no. 50 will take you right there.

person alpha:
thank you.

person beta:
how are you wedding plans going?

person alpha:
very well. we started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done. the only thing that isn't ready yet is my wedding dress.

person beta:
when will that be ready?

person alpha:
the dressmakers said that is would be ready in two weeks.

person beta:
you're getting married in three weeks. so that should be ok. so, you've prepared the church, catering, transport, hotel-everything.

person alpha:
yes. we've taken care of all of that. we decided not to get married in a church though. neither of us is very religious.

person beta:
which hotel will the reception be held at?

person alpha:
the palace hotel they're taking care of the catering, including the wedding cake. i'm sure they'll do a good job.

person beta:
oh, yes. it's and excellent hotel. a friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect, though very expensive.

person alpha:
yes. it will be expensive, but we think it will be worth it. it gives us great peace of mind to know that our reception is in the hands of experienced people.

person beta:
i think you make the right decision.

person alpha:
have you any round-neck sweater?

person beta:
yes. actually our range of sweaters is the most comprehensive available.

person alpha:
can i try this one on?

person beta:
sure, go ahead.

person alpha:
the color is too bright.for my age, i would prefer a lighter color.

person beta:
so dick, how about getting some coffee for tonight?

person alpha:
coffee? i don't honestly like that kind of stuff.

person beta:
come on, you can at least try a little, besides your cigarette.

person alpha:
what's wrong with that? cigarette is the thing i go crazy for.

person beta:
not for me, dick.

person alpha:
you guys are charging me$ 10 for a movie that i never ordered or saw.

person beta:
let's see, sir. according to your file, you watched'titanic'monday evening.

person alpha:
well, the wrong information is in my file. i was at a concert monday night.

person beta:
well, your word overrules the file, sir. one moment, please.

person alpha:
i knew you'd see it my way.

person beta:
sir, i deleted the$ 10, but i had to add a$ 2 service charge to your bill.

person alpha:
am i in the twilight zone? you're charging me for a movie i never saw?

person beta:
please don't blame me, sir. blame the computer programmer.

person alpha:
this is highway robbery. i've got a good mind to call the police!

person beta:
if it makes you feel any better, other guests feel the same way.

person alpha:
mr. carter has asked me to come over to invite you to the banquet held in your honor at the shangri-la hotel at 7:00 this evening. here's an invitation for you.

person beta:
how nice of him. i'll be delighted to go. but what time would be convenient?

person alpha:
if you could be ready by, say 6:30 o'clock, i'll be at the hotel to pick you up.

person beta:
that's great. it's most thoughtful of you to do this, miss rose.

person alpha:
it's my pleasure. well, then. i'll say goodbye.

person beta:
goodbye and see you tonight. miss rose.

person alpha:
i'd like to speak dr.johnson.

person beta:
sorry, but he's not in. may i take a message for you?

person alpha:
this is robert jordan.would you ask him to call me back, please?

person beta:
ok, i'll tell him.

person alpha:
good morning, sir. may i see your passport?

person beta:
yes, of course. here it is.

person alpha:
thank you. are all these yours?

person beta:
no, some of them are my friend's. do you want her passport, too?

person alpha:
yes, please. do you have any carry-on items?

person beta:
do you want me to put it on the belt, too?

person alpha:
yes, please. would you please open this big suitcase?

person beta:
ok. just a moment. it's just some clothes and toiletries.

person alpha:
ok. do you have anything to declare?

person beta:
i think there is nothing.

person alpha:
any fresh food, live plants, or animals?

person beta:
oh, no. none of that.

person alpha:
thank you. you may lock up your suitcase. here are your passports.

person beta:
thanks a lot.

person alpha:
hello. i bought a china dress in your shop this morning.

person beta:
yes?

person alpha:
i bought it one size up by mistake.

person beta:
oh, did you?

person alpha:
i wonder if you can change it to one size down.

person beta:
yes, of course.will you come with the receipt?

person alpha:
then i'll come to your place later in the evening, and how late is your shop open?

person beta:
until 8 o'clock, ma'am. we are looking forward to seeing you.

person alpha:
the boss announces the pay raise today, right? how much do you think we'll get?

person beta:
no idea. your guess is as good as mine.

person alpha:
it better be more than last year.

person beta:
well, anything is better than nothing. wait and see.

person alpha:
i'm going to go shopping for groceries in a little bit.

person beta:
why, do we need groceries?

person alpha:
i believe we are all out of food.

person beta:
do you know what to get?

person alpha:
i don't know what we need.

person beta:
why don't you go and check the refrigerator?

person alpha:
i would appreciate it if you would do that for me.

person beta:
why don't you just get the basics?

person alpha:
what do you mean?

person beta:
eggs, milk, bread. things like that.

person alpha:
go make that list.

person beta:
sure, no problem.

person alpha:
hello, take a seat please. let's get straight to the point. this is our contract. please read it carefully before signing.

person beta:
since we have reached an agreement on all terms, there shouldn't be any problems for the contract.

person alpha:
may we once more remind you that the contract should be canceled by one month notice.

person beta:
yes, i got it. thanks.

person alpha:
excuse me, is this the baggage claim area from kl17?

person beta:
yes, can i help you?

person alpha:
well, this is my baggage claim tag. can you get my baggage now?

person beta:
ok, here you are.

person alpha:
thanks a lot.

person beta:
were you able to attend friday night's basketball game?

person alpha:
i was unable to make it.

person beta:
you should have been there. it was intense.

person alpha:
is that right. who ended up winning?

person beta:
our team was victorious.

person alpha:
i wish i was free that night. i'm kind of mad that i didn't go.

person beta:
it was a great game.

person alpha:
what was the score at the end of the game?

person beta:
our team won 101-98.

person alpha:
sounds like it was a close game.

person beta:
that's the reason it was such a great game.

person alpha:
the next game, i will definitely be there.

person beta:
have you ever tried shopping online?

person alpha:
no, never. i prefer to actually see and touch what i'm buying before i pay for it, especially for clothes and shoes.

person beta:
that's right. seeing is believing.

person alpha:
i've heard some friends say when they get the article, it's quite different from what they see on the website advertisement.

person beta:
that happens. without close quality examination, we may encounter fraud, and the e-shop may suddenly disappear.

person alpha:
what's more, it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password.

person beta:
it's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem. paying online is much safer than before, but i still have the feeling that it's not safe enough.

person alpha:
i can't agree more. that's why i only do street shopping.

person beta:
me too. sometimes i surf online shops to check some related information, and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping.

person alpha:
that's a good idea.

person beta:
how long does it take to get to downtown from here?

person alpha:
it is 15 minutes'drive.

person beta:
what companies do we have in our neighborhood?

person alpha:
mitsubishi, hp, ibm and many other famous corporations.

person beta:
does the 7th floor belong to our company too?

person alpha:
yes, our company has two floors, the 6th and 7th floor in this building.

person beta:
it's such a large firm. do we have our own staff restaurant?

person alpha:
yes, at the end of the hall.

person beta:
good morning, sir. may i help you?

person alpha:
good morning, i have an appointment with mr. johnson at 10:00

person beta:
excuse me, sir, but are you mr. richard of world trading company?

person alpha:
yes. that's right.

person beta:
i'm sorry, mr. richard. mr. johnson is on his way to the office. he had just called and asked you to wait a minute.

person alpha:
well, i'll wait.

person beta:
would you like something to drink, sir? do you prefer coffee or tea?

person alpha:
thank you. coffee, please.

person beta:
here you are, mr. richard. this is the cream and this is the sugar. if there's anything else you'd like, please don't hesitate to tell me.

person alpha:
thank you very much.

person beta:
911. how may i help you?

person alpha:
i need to report a break-in.

person beta:
when did this break-in occur?

person alpha:
last night.

person beta:
where did the break-in happen?

person alpha:
it happened at my house.

person beta:
was anything taken?

person alpha:
i'm not sure yet.

person beta:
what makes you think there was a break-in?

person alpha:
my front window was busted.

person beta:
i'll send a squad car.

person alpha:
please hurry.

person beta:
good morning, everyone. let me introduce myself to you...

person alpha:
you don't need to introduce yourself, yang. you're famous.

person beta:
well, thank you very much but i thought l'd try and chair the meeting by the rule-- at least for a while.

person alpha:
ok, ok!

person beta:
now, i'd like to get things under way. the main topic on today's agenda is the development of a u. s. sales strategy for the new ebb. i'd like to hear all of your ideas, mr. wall, you seem in top form today. could you start the ball rolling?

person alpha:
uh, oh, sure. well, i think we should keep in mind that the key to good sales is advertising.

person beta:
well, that's kind of obvious.

person alpha:
give me a break, mr yang.

person beta:
uh, let's keep this going, shall we?

person alpha:
i'm sorry, but i don't think this damage is our fault.

person beta:
what do you mean?

person alpha:
it looks like the shipping company did this.

person beta:
we'd better take it up with them, in that case.

person alpha:
i'm glad you could find time to meet with me, mr. johnson. i can't think of a nicer environment for our meeting today, the ambiance here is lovely!

person beta:
no problem, if possible i always combine business with pleasure. now, let's hear more about these chocolates you're offering.

person alpha:
well, as you know, i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bon-bons here in the united states. they're a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market. naturally, your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately. i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant, luxurious, first class dining.

person beta:
mmmm, sounds interesting... gourmet chocolates, where are they produced? belgium?

person alpha:
actually, the factory is located in scotland.

person beta:
really? i didn't think they were known for their luxury chocolate production

person alpha:
that's what makes this such a fantastic opportunity! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units. they've also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well. here, i brought these especially for you, try one!

person beta:
oh, thanks. mmm, hmm, creamy texture, very smooth...

person alpha:
unique, aren't they? i bet you've never tasted anything like it! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one's cutting corners with the ingredients. only the creme make it through inspection.

person beta:
yes, very interesting flavors... slightly spicy, very unique, that's for sure. exactly what are the ingredients?

person alpha:
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the granger family for generations. i'm sure you can keep a secret. buttermilk, cacao beans, sugar and haggis.

person beta:
haggis? what's haggis?

person alpha:
it's a traditional scottish delicacy, you take sheep's liver, heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep's stomach.

person beta:
ah, get back to you.

person alpha:
mr. johnson? mr. johnson?

person beta:
do you need a guide?

person alpha:
yes, we are just looking for one. what's the charge per day?

person beta:
it's$ 20. if you are staying for more than 3 days in the city, the charge is$ 16 per day.

person alpha:
that's reasonable.

person beta:
aren't you jim green?

person alpha:
yes, that's right.

person beta:
i believe we met at a concert last year. i'm taylor.

person alpha:
oh, yes. i remember.

person beta:
lucy, i'd like to fix the light in the corridor, it keeps flashing, which drives me crazy. would you like to help me with the ladder?

person alpha:
monica, wait a moment. i think we'd better call the repair man to do it.

person beta:
i think i can handle it by myself.

person alpha:
i'd like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company.

person beta:
i see. if i got hurt when fixing the light, even during office hours, i wouldn't get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility.

person alpha:
other company rules also need your attention.

person beta:
like this one? never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder.yeah, thank you for telling me.

person alpha:
don't mention it.

person beta:
thank god! i am finished writing that service guide! it took me forever!

person alpha:
when did you finish?

person beta:
this morning! no more overtime, and no more headaches!

person alpha:
well, i'm glad to hear it. have a cup of coffee!

person beta:
i didn't receive an unemployment check this week and need to know why.

person alpha:
did you mail us your last continued claim form?

person beta:
i am afraid that i forgot to send it in.

person alpha:
we cannot pay you unless you turn that form in every two weeks.

person beta:
is it too late to mail the continued claim form in now?

person alpha:
it can't be more than fourteen days late for us to accept it.

person beta:
i will mail it in a little early next time to avoid this problem.

person alpha:
you can't possibly know in advance how much you will be working. if you mail it in too soon, we will reject it!

person beta:
will my paycheck arrive late because i messed up on my form?

person alpha:
your check will be arriving late, but the next one will come right on time.

person beta:
i should tell you that i'm checking out in about 30 minutes.

person alpha:
i'm ready when you are, sir.

person beta:
very good! now, it's still morning here in new york.

person alpha:
you are so right, sir. the clock just struck nine.

person beta:
i'm going to spend some time exploring the city. what can i do with my luggage?

person alpha:
sir, right here we have a storage site. its only$ 5 an hour, but you need to leave a deposit.

person beta:
a deposit? isn't my luggage a deposit?

person alpha:
i'm sorry, sir, but it isn't. your mastercard or visa will take care of things nicely.

person beta:
okay. let me think about this.

person alpha:
okay, sir. but don't take too long. you only have 30 minutes.

person beta:
may i take your order?

person alpha:
yes. i'd like a cup of onion soup.

person beta:
and what would you like after that?

person alpha:
i'd like the roast chicken, please.

person beta:
it's the latest and quite popular among young people.

person alpha:
yes, i know and i like it very much. i will take it.

person beta:
sure. here is your receipt.

person alpha:
how long is this cell phone guaranteed?

person beta:
you can refund it in 7 days and exchange it in one year.

person alpha:
hey honey, how was your day?

person beta:
it was alright. i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while. he's in a bit of a jam.

person alpha:
why? what happened?

person beta:
well, his son had an accident and bill doesn't have health insurance. this really got me thinking, and i wondered if we shouldn't look into a couple of different hmo's.

person alpha:
yeah, you're right. we aren't getting any younger and our kids are getting older.

person beta:
exactly! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo's with low co-pays and good coverage. the deductibles are low, too.

person alpha:
sounds good, although, do you think we can qualify for insurance? those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money.

person beta:
well, we don't have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions, so we should be fine.

person alpha:
i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare.

person beta:
not in a million years!

person alpha:
hello. can you tell me what the procedures of applying for a job are?

person beta:
yes, of course. there are many steps. you can apply for the job on the internet and then send your resume to the e-mail address of the company. and wail the feedback of the company.

person alpha:
what is the qualification needed by the position?

person beta:
you must have over 2 years'experience first.

person alpha:
what did you do today?

person beta:
played poker with my work friends.

person alpha:
did you win?

person beta:
of course.

person alpha:
i'd like to withdraw some money from my account.

person beta:
can i see your passbook and the withdrawal slip, please?

person alpha:
sure.

person beta:
let me just make sure. you want to withdraw one thousand dollars?

person alpha:
that's right.

person beta:
can i have a look at that digital camera please?

person alpha:
yes of course. this is a really good one actually.

person beta:
how much does it cost?

person alpha:
this one is 1500 yuan.

person beta:
it looks pretty good. i think i'll take it.

person alpha:
would you like anything else?

person beta:
that's all thank you.

person alpha:
i need something to wash this down. is there any juice in the fridge?

person beta:
what is that? it looks like something from a swamp!

person alpha:
it's a green drink. it's supposed to be full of vitamins and minerals.

person beta:
you know, healthy eating doesn't have to make you gag.

person alpha:
the sales lady said that even if i eat right, i wouldn't get enough vitamins.

person beta:
have you ever tried it? or are you just going to believe the sales lady?

person alpha:
it's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day.

person beta:
it may take less time, but i don't know about easier. yuck.

person alpha:
billy, you are late again.

person beta:
i'm sorry i'm late. i overslept. is the manager here today?

person alpha:
yes he's in his office.

person beta:
oh, i hope he didn't notice me.

person alpha:
don't take any chances. it'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again. he's already mad at you for last 2 times. any more and he might fire you.

person beta:
you said it. it won't happen again. do you really think he'd fire me?

person alpha:
i think he might. you'd better go to his office.

person beta:
you are probably right. i'll go right now and apologize. i try hard not to be late but it is difficult with beijing traffic.

person alpha:
good luck!

person beta:
how much is the rent?

person alpha:
the rent is$ 1500 per month.

person beta:
and how much is the deposit?

person alpha:
the deposit is$ 500.

person beta:
is there anything else, apart from the credit rating and debt to asset ratio?

person alpha:
there is the balance of net liabilities. this must not exceed its net assets and no business loss can be shown during the past two years.

person beta:
right, ok. that, again, shouldn't be a problem.

person alpha:
and the total ratio of return on assets should not be lower than the average, for that particular industry, for the first two quarters of the year.

person beta:
well, as far as i can tell, we qualify.

person alpha:
of course we will need proof, originals and duplicate of everything. as soon as you bring in the proof and we assess it, it should be very quick indeed.

person beta:
do you understand any other foreign languages besides english?

person alpha:
yes, i know a little about japanese which is similar to chinese not only in culture but in language itself.

person beta:
what band did you pass in japanese language proficiency test?

person alpha:
i passed the band two in lpt, but i will try to achieve band one which is the highest level.

person alpha:
thank you, doctor. i'll do what you say.

person beta:
may i see your passport, please?

person alpha:

person beta:

person beta:
how long will you be staying?

person alpha:
just two weeks.

person beta:
how many pieces of baggage have you got?

person alpha:
only one. in this case, i have a camera.

person beta:
do you intend to take it out on your departure?

person alpha:
yes, i do.

person beta:

person alpha:
what can i do for you?

person beta:
i'd like some grapefruit juice, marmalade, two scrambled eggs with two sausages, toast, and a pot of black coffee, please. how long will it take?

person alpha:
just a few minutes, ma'am.

person beta:
great. thank you.

person alpha:
hi, sam. i want to buy a pet. do you have any ideas?

person beta:
you really should go to rachel's pet store.

person alpha:
why? anything special there?

person beta:
it's more than special. you can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more.

person alpha:
oh, really? are there any snakes?

person beta:
snakes? there are even rodents and monkeys! it's a world of exotic pets.

person alpha:
that's terrific. i can't wait to check it out.

person beta:
hang on. are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet?

person alpha:
why not? it's so cool.

person beta:
but it will pose a risk to your health.

person alpha:
pardon?

person beta:
i mean, most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria, they are likely to cause immune system problems.

person alpha:
well, i didn't realize that.

person beta:
i don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets, especially for families with young children.

person alpha:
oh, i should have thought of my brother's baby girl. maybe i'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet.

person beta:
yes, good luck, maria.

person alpha:
hello, this is room 1205. our message lamp is flashing.

person beta:
hold on a minute, please.

person alpha:
thank you.

person beta:
i am sorry to have kept you waiting. mr. johns needs a telephone call from you.

person alpha:
would you bring the message to my room.

person beta:
i'm afraid we have nobody available at the moment.

person alpha:
then i'll come down and pick up the message immediately.

person beta:
ok, we wait for you.

person alpha:
guess what? i've got great news!

person beta:
what is it?

person alpha:
well, you know how i've been working at the economist as a proof-reader, right?

person beta:
yes.

person alpha:
well, the editor-in-chief heard that i had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if i was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him.

person beta:
really? that's fantastic! will you get a chance to do any writing?

person alpha:
she said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that i could be in charge of the column until she came back.

person beta:
wow! that's really great news. how often does the magazine come out?

person alpha:
it's a monthly magazine, but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly.

person beta:
are you looking forward to doing more editing work?

person alpha:
yes, but i'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again!

person beta:
do you have any order forms here so that i can get a subscription to the magazine?

person alpha:
i don't have any with me, but i think i could manage to bring a free copy home for you.

person beta:
i'm really looking forward to reading your column.

person alpha:
me, too. do you want to go out to celebrate my good news?

person beta:
sure, where would you like to go?

person alpha:
perhaps we could go to the library festival that's going on at the local bookshop.

person beta:
have you seen the new cosmo magazine that i was reading this morning?

person alpha:
i think i may have seen it on the kitchen table.

person beta:
you're right, thanks. there's an interesting interview with a top director about his latest film that i want to finish.

person alpha:
who's the director?

person beta:
it's martin scorsese. you liked his film, the departed, didn't you?

person alpha:
yes, it was fantastic! can i read the article when you're finished?

person beta:
sure. you know it has an online edition, too. you should go online to read if you want to read it now.

person alpha:
that's ok. i'll wait until you're finished. just out of curiosity, do you have a subscription for that magadize?

person beta:
no. i don't buy it regularly enough for it to be worthwhile.

person alpha:
how much does the magadize cost?

person beta:
it's almost three pounds now, and i think they're going to put the price up to four pounds soon.

person alpha:
that's quite expensive. who is their target audience?

person beta:
cosmo mainly has a middle-class readership, but i think circulation will fall dramatically if the price goes up anymore.

person alpha:
i bet you'll still buy it, though. you wouldn't be able to live without your fashion magazine!

person beta:
wei! this is a first-you didn't bargain!

person alpha:
bargain? i'd feel way too guilty.

person beta:
but you could have saved money.

person alpha:
from a sweet ma?! it's not worth it. plus, i'd happily pay more for these things i bought!

person beta:
f. y. i., there is a flea market nearby, but maybe you're done...

person alpha:
ha! i'm just warming up! please take me there now!

person beta:
can you help me do an internet search?

person alpha:
sure. what do you want to find?

person beta:
i want to find information on the american civil war.

person alpha:
well, can you be more specific? there are a lot of websites about that.

person beta:
yes, i want to know about the battle of gettysburg.

person alpha:
o. k. well, go to google.com, and type in" battle of gettysburg."

person beta:
oh wow, there are a lot of sites.

person alpha:
here, try this one. it's a good site about gettysburg.

person beta:
thanks.

person alpha:
for detailed information, however, you should read a history book.

person beta:
thanks. if i'm interested, i'll go to the library.

person alpha:
i just have to come up for air. i've been here for too long a time.

person beta:
ok. you'd better come back in two hours.

person alpha:
good afternoon. i'd like to speak with tom smith.

person beta:
i'm afraid he's away from his desk at the moment.

person alpha:
do you know when he will be back?

person beta:
he's away on a business trip. he won't be back until some time next week.

person alpha:
is there some way i can get into contact with him?

person beta:
the best way to reach him is by cell phone. i'll give you his number.

person alpha:
thanks. and could i have his e-mail, just in case i can't get him by phone?

person beta:
sure. his cell phone is 09112223 33. and his e-mail is lower case t, smith--that's one word, at, c, c, w, dot, com, dot, t, w.

person alpha:
thank you so much. does he read his e-mails daily?

person beta:
yes. he usually replies immediately.

person alpha:
great. thanks again. you've been very helpful.

person beta:
my pleasure. i hope you get a hold of him.

person alpha:
what seems to be the trouble, mr. brown?

person beta:
i'm in pretty bad shape, dr. ford.

person alpha:
oh, in what way?

person beta:
no appetite, always on edge, and i can't sleep well.

person alpha:
did you lose any weight?

person beta:
yes, i have lost quite a few pounds since last month.

person alpha:
when was the last time you had a check-up?

person beta:
about two month ago.

person alpha:
let me take your blood pressure. you look anemic.

person beta:
well, mr. brown, i'm happy to say it's nothing serious.

person alpha:
you're just a little run-down from overwork.

person beta:
what am i supposed to do?

person alpha:
i think all you need is just a vacation.

person beta:
try to get outdoors more and be sure to get more rest.

person alpha:
thank you, doctor. i'll do as you say.

person beta:
good morning, angela, how have you been lately?

person alpha:
morning, michael. i've been very busy lately. one of our other vendors is going out of business and i've been searching for a suitable replacement.

person beta:
well, rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run, sitdown.coffee?

person alpha:
no, thanks. i've been trying to cut down on the caffeine.

person beta:
haha, i could never do that. i'd be a zombie if i didn't have my morning coffee fix. let's get down to business then.

person alpha:
yes. i've come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone. the demand for phone cameras is growing, and pear has been falling behind in the market.

person beta:
that's great! i'm glad to hear that pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon. right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras. is pear still interested in having those?

person alpha:
no, we're changing all the cameras to eight megapixels. we were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal.

person beta:
surely. let's get started by drafting a new contract.

person alpha:
can i get my dress today?

person beta:
you have ordered a red dress, is that right?

person alpha:
yes. is that available now?

person beta:
yes, here you are. try it in front of the mirror.

person alpha:
did you hear about the robbery?

person beta:
did i hear about it? i saw it happen.

person alpha:
are you serious?

person beta:
i was there.

person alpha:
what happened?

person beta:
a man came into the bank with a gun.

person alpha:
that's insane.

person beta:
i was so scared when i saw the gun.

person alpha:
then what happened?

person beta:
he took the money and tried to get away.

person alpha:
did the cops show up in time?

person beta:
he didn't even make it out the door.

person alpha:
hello! what are you reading about in the newspaper?

person beta:
hello! i was exhausted form studying, so i decided to read the newspaper to relax. unfortunately, the news is so depressing. there has been another murder in the city center. i'm shocked that the pole

person alpha:
people are starting to get frightened by it. everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder.

person beta:
you mean if they catch the murderer. i'm scared stiff about going into the city center at night.

person alpha:
there must have been some good news in the newspaper. i can't believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited.

person beta:
well, there was one good piece of news. you remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease?

person alpha:
yes. her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states.

person beta:
well, they've got the money and she's going tomorrow for treatment.

person alpha:
i'm so happy for the family! they must be very relieved and excited about that.

person beta:
i'm sure they are. oh, and a local man won the lottery. i'm so jealous! i wish it were me! i buy a lottery ticket every week and i'm amazed that i haven't even won a small prize yet. it's so unfair!

person alpha:
don't be moody! i hope you're not tired, because we've been invited to a party this evening. i know how excited you get about parties.

person beta:
how much is it all together?

person alpha:
let me see. the bell-bottom pants are$ 90 and the coat is$ 120. it comes to$ 210.

person beta:
is it possible for you to reduce the price?

person alpha:
i am sorry. it's a one-price shop.

person beta:
this is the bell captain's desk. may i help you?

person alpha:
yes, i've been waiting for my bags to be sent up for the last half hour. where are they?

person beta:
i'm very sorry to hear that. may i have your name and room number, please?

person alpha:
yes, it's yao lan. room 406.

person beta:
and how many pieces did you have?

person alpha:
two suitcases and a handbag. the suitcases are blue and the shoulder bag is red.

person beta:
is there a name tag attached to them?

person alpha:
yes, there is.

person beta:
we're very sorry for the delay. i'll check immediately and call you back.

person alpha:
are you finished?

person beta:
yes.may i have some more beer?

person alpha:
oh, sure. i'll be back in a minute.thank you for waiting. here it is.did you enjoy your meal?

person beta:
yes, the meal was very delicious and i enjoyed very much. i'm full.

person alpha:
is that so? i'm glad you enjoyed it.

person beta:
by the way, miss.where is the toilet?

person alpha:
toilets are in the rear. i'm afraid all the toilets are fully occupied at the moment.

person beta:
what?

person alpha:
you look fresh recently.how do you make it?

person beta:
i attend an aerobic class three times a week.

person alpha:
aren't you tired?

person beta:
no, i feel young, fresh and energetic.

person alpha:
hello, this is liu juan speaking. is that mr. brown?

person beta:
no, this isn't.

person alpha:
could you please get him on the phone?

person beta:
sure. wait a minute.

person alpha:
it's especially cold when the wind is blowing.

person beta:
why don't you wear a scarf?

person alpha:
what can wearing one do for me?

person beta:
you're cold because the wind is blowing into your open collar. it's not because your jacket isn't thick enough.

person alpha:
so wearing a scarf helps your body to stay warm inside your jacket.

person beta:
yes. that's the secret to wearing a thin jacket.

person alpha:
you know, sometimes i can't feel my ears and fingers.

person beta:
i'll lend you my gloves and earmuffs until you get your own.

person alpha:
thanks, pam. you're my lifesaver.

person beta:
hey, could you help me try and figure out how to get ready for my job interview?

person alpha:
the most important thing to do is to make sure you know the company and what services or products it provides. do you know all about them?

person beta:
yes, i pretty much understand the company.

person alpha:
well, after you've done your research, you have to decide whether the company is casual or formal. have you decided what they are yet?

person beta:
yes, i've been observing them.

person alpha:
when you are choosing what to wear, keep all of that in mind. have you chosen what to wear?

person beta:
i already have something to wear.

person alpha:
i would always be ready to go shopping with you! should we talk about other basics?

person beta:
ok, i am ready to think of other things.

person alpha:
you need to make sure you arrive on time, smile, be pleasant and friendly, look the person in the eye and answer all questions to the best of your ability. you'll do great!

person beta:
is there anything i can do for you?

person alpha:
would you please show me that mural?

person beta:
certainly. here you are.

person alpha:
it looks so beautiful. how much is it?

person beta:
four hundred yuan.

person alpha:
that's a bit more than i wanted to pay. can you cut the price down a bit?

person beta:
i'm sorry. ours is a fixed price shop and i can assure you this is the best price you can get for a mural like this.

person alpha:
maybe you are right. ok, i'll take it.

person beta:
well, i'll have it wrapped for you.

person alpha:
thank you. here is four hundred yuan.

person beta:
thank you. please come again.

person alpha:
it's so great to be here! i'm so excited to help you and my daughter with your new home!

person beta:
we're glad that you're here. would you like a tour of the house?

person alpha:
that'd be great, but could i have a cup of tea first?

person beta:
sure, i'll just go put the kettle on. why don't you have a seat on the sofa and i'll go take care of things in the kitchen.

person alpha:
that would be lovely, thanks.

person beta:
do you take milk or sugar with your tea?

person alpha:
i'll take a little milk, but no sugar, please. make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup.

person beta:
ok. what do you think about our living room?

person alpha:
well, i do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table, but i don't really care for curtains. did you get them at a yard sale? they look ancient.

person beta:
my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift.

person alpha:
oh dear. well, i suppose they will do for now. do you ever dust in here? it seems a bit dusty in here.

person beta:
your daughter usually does the dusting, and i do the vacuuming.

person alpha:
i see. well, i can help with the chores while i'm here. you two could probably use my help.

person beta:
that's very nice of you to offer. here's your tea. be careful, it's still quite hot.

person alpha:
my lease ends next month, so i have to find a new place.

person beta:
i feel sorry for you. it's a jungle out there.

person alpha:
do you know any places?

person beta:
well. i guess i can ask around to see if anyone's got a room or apartment available.

person alpha:
thank you. i think i should also have a look at the internet to see if anyone's got a sublet.

person beta:
how much do are you looking to spend?

person alpha:
i can only afford about 1,000 yuan a month.

person beta:
looks like you'll have to get a place in the suburbs.

person alpha:
it doesn't matter, but it needs to be close to the subway or on a convenient bus route.

person beta:
anything you need to have in the place?

person alpha:
i want a bedroom with full bath, and it'll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side.

person beta:
you can also check out university bulletin boards.

person alpha:
why? will those be students who are leaving?

person beta:
not really, but landlords put up notices to attract students and they often have low rent.

person alpha:
thank you. i'll be sure to take a look.

person beta:
good luck.

person alpha:
good afternoon, how may i help you?

person beta:
hi, i'd like to order some flowers.

person alpha:
who are they for?

person beta:
they're for my wife. her name is samantha.

person alpha:
what kind of flowers would you like?

person beta:
i don't know. i don't know too much about flowers. can you recommend something?

person alpha:
ok. what's the reason you are sending her flowers?

person beta:
today's her birthday and she told me she wants me to buy her flowers.

person alpha:
do you know what kind of flowers she likes?

person beta:
i'm not sure. i know i should know that, but i can't remember right now.

person alpha:
well, they're for your wife, so i think you should give her roses.

person beta:
roses will be fine.

person alpha:
what color?

person beta:
i think red would be nice.

person alpha:
do you want to pick them up or should we deliver them?

person beta:
can you deliver them, please?

person alpha:
what's the address?

person beta:
241 main street.

person alpha:
what do you think i should do, doctor?

person beta:
why don't you try chinese herbal medicine?

person alpha:
is it useful for me?

person beta:
you have to try at least.

person alpha:
ok. thanks a lot.

person beta:
that's nothing.

person alpha:
what do you need today?

person beta:
i need to take a few classes.

person alpha:
what kind of classes would you like to take?

person beta:
how about a driver's course?

person alpha:
okay, you're going to need to make an appointment.

person beta:
i don't understand why i need to make an appointment.

person alpha:
you need to make one to come down and fill out your paperwork.

person beta:
i'd like to make one now if i could.

person alpha:
sure you can; when would you like to come in?

person beta:
i'd like to come in tomorrow morning at 9

person alpha:
that'll be fine.

person beta:
that's great. thank you very much.

person alpha:
hello, thank you for calling bradford and sons. this is tracy speaking, how may i help you?

person beta:
hello. i would like to speak to your director of human resources, ms.jenkins, please.

person alpha:
just a moment. i'll check to see if she is at her desk.may i tell her who is calling?

person beta:
this is bill burton from milford insurance, i'm calling in regards to our meeting next tuesday.

person alpha:
thank you, mr.burton.can you please hold for a moment? i'll check to see if she is available.

person beta:
no problem.

person alpha:
i'm sorry, ms.jenkins is away from her desk.she has already left for lunch.would you like to leave a message for her?

person beta:
how's jimmy today?

person alpha:
better, thank you, doctor.

person beta:
can i see him please, mrs williams?

person alpha:
certainly, doctor. come upstairs.

person beta:
you look very well, jimmy. you are better now, but you mustn't get up yet.you must stay in bed for another two days.the boy mustn't go to school yet, mrs williams. and he mustn't eat rich food.

person alpha:
does he have a temperature, doctor?

person beta:
no, he doesn't.

person alpha:
must he stay in bed?

person beta:
yes. he must remain in bed for another two days. he can get up for about two hours each day, but you must keep the room warm. where's mr williams this evening?

person alpha:
he's in bed, doctor. can you see him, please? he has a bad cold, too!

person beta:
well, tell me something of yourself.

person alpha:
what would you like to know, mr. green?

person beta:
what working experience have you get?

person alpha:
in 2004, i got a job in the sales department of a trading company near guangzhou. i started a sales representative. a year later, i was promoted to the position of sales manager. i had that job ever since, which is just over a year now.

person beta:
oh, good. irene, can you tell me why you plan to quit being a sales manager to work here as my assistant? don't you like your present job?

person alpha:
frankly, some part of it i enjoy very much, but i prefer something more professional. it happens that i have a friend working here in this company. she told me the export department was to recruit an assistant. i felt very excited at this news. that's why i'm here.

person beta:
this looks wonderful, madame culot.

person alpha:
yes, it's very nice. all our foreign visitors enjoy it. the food is wonderfully well-prepared. let me know if you need any help with the menu.

person beta:
thank you. mmm. can you tell me about the terrine?

person alpha:
yes. a terrine is a kind of meat pate. it's meat turned into a paste. it sounds horrible but it's actually really good.

person beta:
mmm. maybe another time.

person alpha:
you could try the ravioli. they are rather like your chinese dumplings, and the sauce is delicious.

person beta:
sounds good. i think i'll have the lamb for my main course. what does it come with?

person alpha:
well, you can have fries-french fries-or simple boiled potatoes.

person beta:
i'll have the potatoes. what are you having?

person alpha:
i'm having my usual. i like the fish here. would you like some wine?

person beta:
oh, yes. that would be lovely.

person alpha:
hi, could we have two orange juice smoothies?

person beta:
would you like those with yogurt?

person alpha:
sure, why not?

person beta:
what else would you like to add? we highly recommend caterpillar fungus.

person alpha:
caterpillar fungus?! what the heck is that?

person beta:
it's a special kind of chinese herb. it's good for you!

person alpha:
wow, amy, look at that number.

person beta:
what's so great about it?

person alpha:
what do you mean? it's a scrim.

person beta:
not to me, i wouldn't be caught dead in that.

person alpha:
i love that kind of stuff.

person beta:
yeah, you seem to like those styles.

person alpha:
sure do. i get a kick out of looking punk.

person beta:
this one looks really expensive though.

person alpha:
i don't care how much it costs. i'm rolling in it.

person beta:
lucky you! i can't buy anything else. i'm flat broke.

person alpha:
i got a replace my party outfit, i trashed it last week.

person beta:
why did you drag me into this? i've spent a week salary.

person alpha:
are you on the level? you're the one who called me, remember?

person beta:
just joking, tonia. i've got some wonderful clothes. let's go and have a close look at your outfit.

person alpha:
i have just received your note which informs me that you have offered the accountant position to another candidate. may i ask why i was defeated?

person beta:
we have thought of you carefully with discretion, but the other candidate has more experiences.

person alpha:
experience is important, but don't you think capability is more valuable than that?

person beta:
yes, i think so. but how do you prove to me that you are more capable?

person alpha:
maybe you can hire me on trial. if i'm not qualified for the job, you can let me go.

person beta:
good idea.

person alpha:
excuse me, sir.is there a barber near here?

person beta:
yes, the nearest one is at the third cross of this road.

person alpha:
i'm a stranger here.how can i get there, please?

person beta:
just walk down the road for a few minutes, and you'll find it on your right.

person alpha:
thank you very much.

person beta:
unfortunately, according to our regulations i have to confiscate these counterfeit notes.

person alpha:
so, this 500 rib is worthless?

person beta:
i'm sorry but it is our regulation, so i must follow it. we will issue you with a receipt to show that the notes you presented us with are counterfeit and have been confiscated. then, if you wish to pay in some more cash, you are free to do so.

person alpha:
right, i see. let me give you another 500 rib.

person beta:
here's your passbook back and the receipt to say we confiscated the 500 rib worth of counterfeit notes.

person alpha:
thanks. now can i make the full deposit?

person beta:
yes. please fill in a new deposit slip and we can continue.

person alpha:
ok, honey, time to take down the christmas tree.

person beta:
do we have to?

person alpha:
come on, it's losing needles all the time and the branches are sagging.

person beta:
it's not that bad, besides it really looks nice in that corner. it gives the room a good atmosphere.

person alpha:
a good atmosphere? the tree is falling apart, and it's messing up the room.

person beta:
but it makes the place feel so much like christmas. i'd really hate to have to take it down.

person alpha:
but christmas was two weeks ago! it's been there only because we've been too busy to get rid of it.

person beta:
i know, but it seems like such a shame to have to take it away.

person alpha:
but it's falling apart, and the cat keeps playing with the lower branches.

person beta:
i know, i know. but it reminds me of the great christmas we just had. all of us were here-- my parents, your parents, the kids, and the cousins-- the food was good, and everybody got what they wanted.

person alpha:
yeah, it was a good christmas. it won't always be this good, but we can't make it last longer than it should.

person beta:
ok, fine. we need to take down the tree.

person alpha:
i'll make a deal with you. we'll leave it up until sunday, and then we'll take it down after church.

person beta:
welcome, how may i help you today?

person alpha:
i'm ask for a pizza, please.

person beta:
then you will be happy to here that today all our pizzas are on sale. two for one.

person alpha:
you're right, that is great.

person beta:
what size would you like?

person alpha:
medium one will be perfect, thank you

person beta:
which kind do you want?

person alpha:
i like seafood on my pizza.

person beta:
we have two seafood pizzas. tuna and crab.

person alpha:
tuna sounds good today.

person beta:
would that be for here or take away?

person alpha:
that would be to go.

person beta:
that'll be in a ten minutes. please sit over there, and i'll call you over as sooner as it's ready.

person alpha:
no problem.

person beta:

i really love how rain clears the air.

some are better than others. but, you shouldn't have a problem.

person alpha:

hello, yes, i'd like to open a bank account.

person alpha:
certainly, i can can help you with that. what type of account would you like to open? a chequing or a savings account?

person beta:
what what features do they offer?

person alpha:
well, if you just take a look here, see, with our chequing account, you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee, and our savings account has a higher interest rate, but you must carry a minimum balance of$ 10,000 dollars.

person beta:
i see, well, i think i'm more interested in a chequing account. i like to have easy access to my money.

person alpha:
alright, then, with this chequing account you'll be issued a debit card and a cheque book. will you require overdraft protection? there is an extra fee for that.

person beta:
no, that won't be necessary.

person alpha:
in that case, i'll get you to fill out this paperwork. i'll need your social insurance number, and two pieces of government id. if you could just sign here, and here, and here. we'll be all set. would you like to make a deposit today?

person beta:
yes, i'd like to deposit one billion dollars.

person alpha:
would you check the engine, please? it is knocking.

person beta:
sure. do you want to have the car washed?

person alpha:
yes, please. when can you get it done?

person beta:
you can pick it up in half an hour. by the way, how are you going to pay, cash or credit?

person alpha:
by credit.

person beta:
have you decided what you're going to do during your holiday?

person alpha:
yes. i'm going to travel around europe.

person beta:

it's nice to meet you, too.

person beta:
i am happy to be speaking to a presidential candidate.

person alpha:
would you like to ask me anything?

person beta:
what do you feel about gay marriage?

person alpha:
i think everyone has the right to love who they want.

person beta:
would you legalize gay marriage?

person alpha:
yes, i would.

person beta:
many people won't like that.

person alpha:
i'm sure they won't, but that's my view on gay marriage.

person beta:
i really like you.

person alpha:
i really appreciate that.

person beta:
hello? this is john smith.can i speak to mr.white, please?

person alpha:
this is mr.white speaking.

person beta:
ok. i will be there.

person alpha:
thank you for calling.goodbye.

person beta:
bye.

person alpha:
please fill in the arrival card and sign the register.

person beta:
marketing manage office, can i help you?

person alpha:
mr green, please.

person alpha:
no, thanks. i'll call back later.

person beta:
that's fine.please call again later.

person alpha:
ok, thank you.goodbye.

person beta:
so tell me, what's the difference between the board of directors, the ceo, and the stockholders? they all seems ot be the same group of people to me...

person alpha:
no, there's a definite difference. you know, the stockholders are the people who own the company... they're the financial control system. then there's the ceo-- the chief executive officer. he's the hot shot, the main guy who is the boss. if there is only one person with absolute power in the organization, everyone knows that the power will go to their head. it's too dangerous. that's the reason for a board of directors. the board is made up of people who are experts in the industry. they could be related to the organization, but more commonly, they are independent and non-biased.

person beta:
how many people are on the board of directors?

person alpha:
usually not more than 15, not less than 10. they meet monthly, quarterly, or biannually to oversee an organization or company. they provide long term planing and vision, and also act as moral watchdogs rto keep the company in line.

person beta:
how much will my pay be, if you don't mind my asking?

person alpha:
we would like to start you off at 1,500 yuan a month, not including bonus and overtime pay. we don't give bonus every month, but we offer a semi-annual bonus. and you will receive two weeks paid vacation a year, as well. does it suit you?

person beta:
yes, thank you. may i ask for an apartment?

person alpha:
no problem. we'll supply you with an apartment of two bedrooms and a living room.

person beta:
mum, can i finish my homework later?

person alpha:
sorry. you know the rules.

person beta:
but i want to watch tv now.

person alpha:
that's out of the question.

person beta:
please.

person alpha:
not a chance.

person beta:
not even for an hour?

person alpha:
sorry, it's impossible.

person beta:
where's sally, jack?

person alpha:
she's in the garden, jane.

person beta:
what's she doing?

person alpha:
she's sitting under the tree.

person beta:
is tim in the garden, too?

person alpha:
yes, he is. he's climbing the tree.

person beta:
i beg your pardon? who's climbing the tree.

person alpha:
tim is.

person beta:
what about the dog?

person alpha:
the dog's in the garden, too. it's running across the grass. it's running after a cat.

person beta:
what's wrong with you?

person alpha:
i have a sore throat and headache.

person beta:
do you feel tired?

person alpha:
yes, my whole body feels weak. and i really feel terrible.

person beta:
i'm sorry to hear that. i'll have to examine you.

person alpha:
ok, go ahead.

person beta:
open your mouth and show me your tongue. say ah... you have a bad cold. so you must stay in bed for a week.

person alpha:
leo! i wanted to tell you thanks for all your hard work on the budget. we're having a get-together after work tonight at carl's karaoke club to celebrate having finished it. we'd love to see

person beta:
what fun! normally i'd love to, but i'm afraid i have to work late tonight. we've got to get the contract ready for miss king.

person alpha:
oh, right. you're busy with that contract. maybe you could join us later?

person beta:
unfortunately, i just can't make it this time. i have to go straight home. it's my second wedding anniversary, and we're supposed to be having a big dinner susan would kill me if i missed it.

person alpha:
happy anniversary! sorry you won't be there. maybe some other time?

person beta:
yeah, maybe. thanks, anyway. hope you guys have a great time!

person alpha:
excuse me. do you mind if i try this on?

person beta:
not at all. the changing rooms are just this way.

person alpha:
thanks. it's a little tight. do you have any in a larger size?

person beta:
sure. i'll give you the next size up. that one is small, right?

person alpha:
yes. also, i'm not so sure about the color.

person beta:
well.it doesn't go with your skirt. i think the color itself is fine though.

person alpha:
are you going to vote?

person beta:
of course! are you?

person alpha:
i plan to, but what day is the election?

person beta:
you should know that.

person alpha:
can you just tell me?

person beta:
the election is this tuesday.

person alpha:
are you serious?

person beta:
i'm not kidding.

person alpha:
it's a good thing i asked you.

person beta:
that should've been something you knew already.

person alpha:
i couldn't remember.

person beta:
whatever. just make sure you go vote.

person alpha:
dave, there's something i want to talk to you about.

person beta:
zina, why are you whispering?

person alpha:
i've been talking to webtracker. i'm thinking of jumping ship.

person beta:
what? are you serious? you'd defect to our archrival!?

person alpha:
keep your voice down. we'll talk more later. right now i need to see vince.

person beta:
we definitely have to talk, zina. and watch your back. elvin is still mad about his nose.

person alpha:
ok, but don't tell anyone what i said.

person beta:
you get your bus pass?

person alpha:
i'm not going to buy one.

person beta:
you're not?

person alpha:
i think it's a waste of money.

person beta:
it actually costs less if you have a bus pass.

person alpha:
how is that?

person beta:
you can use it however many times you need to.

person alpha:
is that right?

person beta:
yup, and you can keep the money in your pocket.

person alpha:
that sounds nice.

person beta:
you should go get yours.

person alpha:
yeah, i think i will.

person beta:
good morning. craftsman company. can i help you?

person alpha:
yes, good morning. this is mr. suzuki from video tv. may i speak to mr. johnson?

person beta:
i'm sorry, but mr. johnson is out at the moment. can i take a message?

person alpha:
uh, yes, okay. tell him john suzuki called. that's s-u-z-u-k-i.

person beta:
yes.

person alpha:
from video tv.

person beta:
yes, video tv.

person alpha:
tell him i telephoned. i'd like to see him about the videotapes. can he call me this afternoon?

person beta:
yes, of course. what's your telephone number?

person alpha:
it's, area code 413, 447-9626.

person beta:
that is 413-447-9662?

person alpha:
no, that's 447-9626.

person beta:
oh, i'm sorry, 447-9626.

person alpha:
yes, that's right. extension 162.

person beta:
extension 162. okay, mr. suzuki. i'll give him the message.

person alpha:
thank you. good-bye.

person beta:
good-bye.

person alpha:
it's quit a big cafeteria, isn't it?

person beta:
sure. i usually have my lunch here. the food is tasty and they offer a big variety.

person alpha:
let's line up. the steak is very inviting. i'll have it.

person beta:
i'll have ham and egg with french fries. what dessert do you want?

person alpha:
banana pie.

person beta:
where shall we sit?

person alpha:
how about there?

person beta:
do you like cooking?

person alpha:
i love it. i really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it.it gives me a real sense of satisfaction.do you enjoy cooking?

person beta:
i don't like it.it takes up too much time and i really hate having it clean up after the meal. i can't stand doing the washing up, drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away.

person alpha:
you can ask the guests for help. my guests usually insist on doing the washing up. i just have to remind them where everything goes.

person beta:
so what kinds of dishes do you usually make? i know you like italian food.

person alpha:
italian, indian and chinese. i've only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice.

person beta:
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food?

person alpha:
not at all.you can find most of them in supermarkets.the ingredients are usually the same as in western food.the way that the food is prepared is the big difference, not the ingredients.

person beta:
how long does it take you to cook a meal for 5 or 6 people?

person alpha:
obviously, it depends on what i'm cooking.but i'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours.

person beta:
i'm searching for an old music box.

person alpha:
you came to the right place. any particular decade?

person beta:
if you had a box made in the'20s, that would be nice.

person alpha:
we just got one in yesterday, so now we have six.

person beta:
would any of them have dancing figures?

person alpha:
yes, we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures.

person beta:
oh, they're both so beautiful. let me have this one, i think.

person alpha:
that one truly is a beautiful piece of work, isn't it?

person beta:
one last question

person alpha:
oh, no. everything we sell here is" as is."

person beta:
i guess i was asking for too much.

person alpha:
if it breaks down, maybe you can find a repairman on the internet.

person beta:
we have been over this a hundred times! we are not getting a pet!

person alpha:
why not? come on! just a cute little puppy. or a kitty!

person beta:
who is going to look after a dog or a cat?

person alpha:
i will! i'll feed it, bathe it and walk it every day! we can get a labrador or a german shepard!

person beta:
what if we want to take a vacation? who will we leave it with? plus, our apartment is too small for that breed of dog.

person alpha:
ok. how about we get a cat or a ferret?

person beta:
we're planning on having children soon, i don't think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house.

person alpha:
fine! let's get a bird then! we can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk! a parrot would be awesome!

person beta:
i'll tell you what, i can get you some hamsters and we'll take it from there.

person alpha:
yay!

person beta:
over here is our gym. we have all the latest equipment.

person alpha:
but i haven't used exercising equipment before. can you tell us some more details?

person beta:
certainly. we have here the race apparatus, stationary bike, muscle builder set, chest expander, bar bell, dumb bell and so on.

person alpha:
working in the gym is a very good way for losing weight. what else do you have?

person beta:
here's the swimming pool. it's open from 10 a. m. to 11 p. m. there are also massage rooms here.

person alpha:
that's wonderful! i like swimming.

person beta:
john, i was looking through some magazines for ideas about where we might go on vacation this year.

person alpha:
i've already told my buddy, mark, that i am going hunting with him in alaska.

person beta:
you can't be serious!

person alpha:
hey, i've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation. i am sorry that bothers you.

person beta:
after a year together, i thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together.

person alpha:
says who? i don't think that is necessarily the case.

person beta:
you know, now that i think about it, i really don't have much more to say to you at all!

person alpha:
whatever you say!

person beta:
have you declared your income and are you prepared to pay tax?

person alpha:
not yet. i don't know how to fill out the form. what is the tax-free allowance for supporting a dependent?

person beta:
i don't really know. why not ask the accountant or the lawyer of the law firm? they will tell you which is subject or not subject to taxation. he can even help you avoid paying tax legally.

person alpha:
if i don't pay my taxes, would the tax officials discover it?

person beta:
certainly. no one who evades tax can escape from their detection.they'll check your income through computers. you'd better make a declaration to the tax authorities as soon as possible. if you fail to meet the deadline, you will be fined.

person alpha:
what's up? you sound a little down in dumps.

person beta:
i quarreled with my roommate last night. he is really stubborn.

person alpha:
calm down! shouting won't help?

person beta:
he is really outrageous.

person alpha:
what happened?

person beta:
i went back home last night. you know tired as a dog, so i took a quick shower and went to bed. i couldn't fall asleep, because brian was there in the living room, playing his stupid stereo so loud. i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit. he shouted at me.

person alpha:
what? he can't do this to you.

person beta:
well, he did it anyway. then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah... you know.

person alpha:
what did you do?

person beta:
i shouted it back of course.

person alpha:
hold it, mike. you won't accomplish anything by hollering at him, right? you worked it all up till now. why not wait until you cool down a bit?

person beta:
what would you do if you were in my shoes?

person alpha:
just stay cool. you know. when you get back home tonight, tell him that you didn't mean to quarrel with him.

person beta:
no way, kate. i mean it's just not my fault.

person alpha:
i know. it wouldn't hurt much to say sorry first. and after that, you can casually mention the problem. i am sure he will cooperate.

person beta:
i am too angry to do that.

person alpha:
excuse me. i am looking for a book called little women, but i can't find it anywhere.

person beta:
let me see. i am sorry we just have sold it out.

person alpha:
will you have it later?

person beta:
i think so. could i have you name, telephone number? if we get one, i will call you.

person alpha:
that's terrific. thank you.

person beta:
who do you think is the greatest novelist in the history of english literature?

person alpha:
charles dickens.actually no one can parallel him in writing.

person beta:
i'm afraid i can't agree with you on that. i like d.h.laurence's novels better.

person alpha:
what game do you like?

person beta:
i like board games. i like chinese chess and draughts.

person alpha:
i've never played chinese chess before, but i've seen old men playing it in the street. it looks complicated.

person beta:
it's about as complicated as chess. the basic rule and moves are simple enough, but there are many strategies that players need to learn.

person alpha:
i like playing cards. i'm pretty good at poker. do you play cards?

person beta:
i'm terrible at cards and so i never play games which involve gambling, like poker. if i did, i'd lose all my money.

person alpha:
do you play bridge?

person beta:
yes, i do. it's hard to find four players though, so i don't play very often. do you know anyone who plays? if so, we could set up a game.

person alpha:
i can play quite well. i have a friend who likes playing, but she's not very good at it. shall i invite her to play?

person beta:
sure, i have a friend who play fairly well. we should find out when our friends are free and arrange a game.

person alpha:
i'll call my friend now. you call yours.

person beta:
can you give me more details on what is included in the package?

person alpha:
sure. the coach leaves at 6:30 a. m., in front of our office. the drive takes eight hours, with two stops to see some sights.

person beta:
what about the hotel accommodations?

person alpha:
you'll be staying at holiday inn. it's a three-star hotel with two restaurants and a swimming pool.

person beta:
great. what types of things will we do at lushun falls?

person alpha:
the second day you take a four-hour city tour. in the afternoon you go on the famous boat cruise under the falls.

person beta:
hello, 332440.

person alpha:
oh hello, sally. this is dave thomson here. could i speak to jim please?

person beta:
i'm afraid he's not in at the moment dave. he went out about an hour ago and he's not back yet.

person alpha:
any idea when he might be back?

person beta:
well, he shouldn't be long. he said he was just going to get some paint. but i wouldn't be surprised if he's stopped off at the pub on the way back.

person alpha:
ok. well, tell him i've called, will you, and i'll try again later.

person beta:
all right. goodbye, dave.

person alpha:
thanks then sally. goodbye.

person beta:
honey, the house is such a mess! i need you to help me tidy up a bit. my boss and her husband are coming over for dinner and the house needs to be spotless!

person alpha:
i'm in the middle of something right now. i'll be there in a second.

person beta:
this can't wait! i need your help now!

person alpha:
alright, alright. i'm coming.

person beta:
ok, here's a list of chores we need to get done. i'll do the dishes and get all the groceries for tonight. you can sweep and mop the floors. oh, and the furniture needs to be dusted.

person alpha:
you know what, i have to pick something up at the mall, so why don't you clean the floors and i'll go to the supermarket and get all the groceries.

person beta:
sure that's fine. here is the list of all the things you need to get. don't forget anything! and can you pick up a bottle of wine on your way home?

person alpha:
hey, honey i'm back. wow, the house looks really good!

person beta:
great! can you set the table?

person alpha:
just a sec i'm just gonna vacuum this rug real fast

person beta:
wait! don't turn it on...

person alpha:
good afternoon, welcome to iba. how can i be of service?

person beta:
i'd like to talk to somebody about the group account deposit service.

person alpha:
this refers to the deposit business offered to the level 1 account of group companies.

person beta:
what is it used for? i mean, why bother to get this special account?

person alpha:
group companies can use this to make their arrangement of funds flexible, when dealing with their subsidiaries.

person beta:
i see, so this can really cut down on time and centralise management. interesting...

person alpha:
is this a duty-free shop?

person beta:
yes, sir. what can i do for you?

person alpha:
i want to buy some specialties. can you recommend me some?

person beta:
sure. i strongly advise you to buy a bottle of perfume and a lighter.

person alpha:
fine. they look nice. i will take both of them.

person beta:
may i have a look at your passport, please?

person alpha:
good morning, sir. can i help you?

person beta:
good morning. i'm interested in antiques. do you have any?

person alpha:
yes, we have a great variety of chinese antiques.

person beta:
what do you have?

person alpha:
well, we have some painting and some porcelain. which do you like better?

person beta:
i'd like porcelain.

person alpha:
good. how about the table set?

person beta:
oh, it looks well. i like it very much.

person alpha:
it's made in jingdezhen.

person beta:
how much is it?

person alpha:
one thousand eight hundred yuan.

person beta:
it's not expensive. i'll take it.

person alpha:
oh, so dalian is hotter than new york now.

person beta:
not hot but warm. very comfortable.

person alpha:
are you staying at the hilton?

person beta:
yes, i have already booked a room.

person alpha:
could you show me what you've got?

person beta:

both of our two parties were involved in the discussion previously. shall we also allow some of our clients to join us?

how should i contact them?

person beta:
you can e-mail your application materials for application to the websites of job agencies for enrollment in their database.

person alpha:
can i get a quick reply from the sites?

person beta:
what do you think about this store? i heard it's a posh store that's only got branches in big cities.

person alpha:
i love this store. the only problem is that it's extremely expensive.

person beta:
don't worry. i've decided that for your birthday i'm going to take you shopping for a new dress.

person alpha:
really? i thought you hated shopping?

person beta:
i do, that's why you should appreciate this gift!

person alpha:

person beta:
how about this red dress? i think it would really suit you.

person alpha:
that's gorgeous! do they have it in a size 8?

person beta:
here you go.on any other day, it would cost me a fortune, but it's on special offer today.

person alpha:
i think this color isn't quite right for me. do they have the same dress in white?

person beta:

person alpha:
i've been trying to get through to the booking office for the last ten minutes. but the line has been engaged all the time. why is it taking so long?

person beta:
i'm sorry to hear that. i'm afraid it is often the case during the peak hours. shall i ask them to call you when the line is free?

person alpha:
ok. please do so if it is not troublesome.

person beta:
no trouble at all. may i know your name and room number?

person alpha:
i'm du juan, in room 312.

person alpha:

person beta:

person alpha:
just this suitcase.

person beta:
your backpack is very big and today's flight is quite full. i am afraid that you will have to check your backpack too.

person alpha:
no problem. what about this carry-on?

person beta:
you can take that with you.

person alpha:

person alpha:

person beta:
15mins before the plane takes off. the plane is scheduled to leave on time.

person alpha:
thank you very much!

person beta:
you are welcome! have a nice flight.

person alpha:
tell me about yourself and your past experience.

person beta:
i have worked as an executive secretary for 5 years, first for trading companies, and now i am working for a trust company. i interact well with peers, clients, administrators and bosses. i thrive on challenge and work well in high-stress environments.

person alpha:
how are your typing and shorthand skills?

person beta:
i can type 100 chinese words a minute and take dictation in english at 150 words a minute.

person alpha:
can you operate computers skillfully?

person beta:
yes, i can. i have received some special training in computers. besides i am good at operating common office machines, such as fax machines and duplicating machines.

person alpha:
sometimes we are very busy and need to work overtime. how do you feel about that?

person beta:
that's all right. but could you tell me how often and how many hours i should work overtime?

person alpha:
it just depends. if we have important visiting delegations, you have to stay with us. it's not unusual.

person beta:
mr. smith, i's like to ask you a question.

person alpha:
ok, please.

person beta:
what specific duties would i perform if i am hired?

person alpha:
nothing different from a secretary's common responsibilities. however, you know, our company is an international trade-oriented company, can you handle english papers and write english correspondence?

person beta:
yes. i specialized in english secretary studies at college and that's one of the main parts of my present job.

person alpha:
what are your salary expectations?

person beta:
i really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary. maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position.

person alpha:
the starting monthly salary would be y= 2,000, with rises after the half year according to your competence.

person beta:
i think it's acceptable and i really like the job. and when can i know the decision?

person alpha:
we'll inform you of our final decision by early july. do you have any other questions?

person beta:
no. thank you for the time.

person alpha:
what do you think about the equipment in our company?

person beta:
we have to equip our company with a network of work stations at every office and show room as soon as possible.

person alpha:
i also realized this issue. and office automation is essential.

person beta:
besides, internet tends to be more essential now in the information age.

person alpha:
good idea. a network of work stations is helpful for our management.

person beta:
and, to be frank, our copying machines are too slow; our telephone system is limited in function.

person alpha:
you are right. the current equipment of our offices really falls behind. next week, you can provide me a catalogue of new equipment.

person beta:
thank your for calling world airline. what can i do for you?

person alpha:
i need to book a plane ticket to london.

person beta:
round-trip or one-way?

person alpha:
one-way.

person beta:
what date would you like to fly?

person alpha:
saturday, july 25.

person beta:
how many people will be traveling?

person alpha:
just one adult.

person beta:
which class?

person alpha:
economy, please. economy class is the cheapest, right?

person beta:
right. ok, the fare is$ 700.

person alpha:
hello, the nurse said that you might have my test results in from the other day.

person beta:
i would like for you to come in and talk about a few more tests that i would like to run.

person alpha:
does this mean that you have bad news for me?

person beta:
i just want to talk to you about the tests that i want to run.

person alpha:
can't you just tell me now?

person beta:
i don't know anything for certain. we always do a double check if there is a question.

person alpha:
i want to see you right away.

person beta:
you can come in this afternoon. if you are feeling too stressed, feel free to bring a friend along.

person alpha:
i know for sure that something is wrong!

person beta:
don't worry about a thing; we are just taking a second look and talking.

person alpha:
you would be using mainly english in this job. do you think you could manage?

person beta:
yes, i am sure i can.

person alpha:
do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken english?

person beta:
yes, i think i am quite proficient in both written and spoken english.

person alpha:
do you think you can make yourself understood in english with ease?

person beta:
yes, i think i can in ordinary circumstances.

person alpha:
do you think you can speak english quite fluently? tell me about your english education.

person beta:
yes, i think i speak english quite fluently. i got a high score on toefl. i majored in english in college.

person alpha:
you are looking really healthy lately. what are you doing differently?

person beta:
thank you for noticing! i've been making a few lifestyle changes over the past year.

person alpha:
tell me about it. i'm interested.

person beta:
well, it all started when my brother challenged me to quit smoking.

person alpha:
ha! that's right. you used to smoke. i forgot!

person beta:
when i kicked that habit, i found i had so much more energy. i started exercising.

person alpha:
at the gym?

person beta:
no. i like to be outside. i took up hiking and mountain biking.

person alpha:
good morning. my name is mr. brown. i'm from australia. here is my card.

person beta:
thank you. i'm pleased to meet you, mr. brown. my name is kathy pewless, the representative of green textile import and export corporation.

person alpha:
pleased to meet you too, ms. pewless. i travel a lot every year on business, but this is my first visit to your country. i must say i have been much impressed by your friendly people.

person beta:
thank you for saying so. have you seen the exhibition halls? on display are most of our products, such as silk, woolen knitwear, cotton piece goods, and garments.

person alpha:
oh, yes. i had a look yesterday. i found some of the exhibits to be fine in quality and beautiful in design. the exhibition has successfully displayed to me what your corporation handles. i've gone over the catalogue and the pamphlets enclosed in your last letter. i've got some idea of your exports. i'm interested in your silk blouses.

person beta:
our silk is known for its good quality. it is one of our trade- trional exports. silk blouses are brightly colored and beau- fully designed. they've met with great favor overseas and are always in great demand.

person alpha:
can you help me plan the office party?

person beta:
sure. what do you need the most help with, the food or entertainment?

person alpha:
i need help with food.

person beta:
ok, well, let's coordinate our efforts. should this party be formal or casual?

person alpha:
i think it should be casual.

person beta:
i agree. next, we have to decide on food. we have a choice of chinese or continental cuisine. which one should we have?

person alpha:
i would prefer chinese food for this party.

person beta:
perfect choice. for music, should we have a live band or a dj?

person alpha:
i think we should hire a live band.

person beta:
ok then. well, i will work on my part and get back to you with my progress on friday.

person alpha:
good morning. thank you for the interview.

person beta:
no problem. now, do you prefer working with others or flying solo?

person alpha:
actually, i enjoy both.

person beta:
so, what is most important to you in a job? do you need job security or professional growth and a chance to advance?

person alpha:
i need job security.

person beta:
would you be able to relocate?

person alpha:
i am open to relocating.

person beta:

i'll keep that in mind. thank you for coming in today. we'll be in touch.

person alpha:

person beta:
yes, it is. please put your luggage on this scale.

person alpha:
ok. is the plane on schedule?

person beta:
yes, it is. how many pieces of hand luggage do you have?

person alpha:
two.

person beta:
i'm looking for a good multivitamin. can you recommend one?

person alpha:
yes. come with me to the vitamin section.

person beta:
i knew there would be a few choices, but this selection is huge!

person alpha:
you're looking for a multi though, right?

person beta:
that's right. just a simple multi-vitamin that i can take every day.

person alpha:
okay. then i recommend this one. it's made especially for men about your age.

person beta:
oh! you took the guesswork right out of that one.

person alpha:
that's my job! is there anything else i can assist you with?

person beta:
i only want a little off the top and the sides and back to have clean lines.

person alpha:
okay. is your hair naturally curly or is it a perm?

person beta:
it's natural. my friend told me you know how to work with curls.

person alpha:
that's my specialty. let me put this around your neck.

person beta:
do you have any product that controls frizz?

person alpha:
with the cut i'll give you, we will minimize a lot of that.

person beta:
thank you!

person alpha:
and when we're done, i'll show you some great stuff to take care of the rest.

person beta:
would you pour me some of that tea, please?

person alpha:
okay. say when.

person beta:
hey, look, there is a circus show over there.

person alpha:
i'm not in the mood.

person beta:
it's the circus.

person alpha:
i don't want to sit there and watch them torturing the animals.

person beta:
oh, come on, they give them treat too.oh, look, that little monkey is so cute.

person alpha:
cute? hope so.

person beta:
oh, it is coming to us, come on, ben, get a banana to it.

person alpha:
me? no way, keep him away from me, please.

person beta:
why are you acting so strange today?

person alpha:
i've said that i've got a problem with the circus. i'm not kidding.

person beta:
that's weird!

person alpha:
now please tell me something about your past work achievements.

person beta:
all right, madam. when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store. i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25% and profit margins from 50% to 80%.

person alpha:
that is quite an achievement! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience?

person beta:
i don't think so. i'll create further achievement in the future.

person alpha:
have you received any honors?

person beta:
yes. i got the title of" advance worker" in 2006.

person alpha:
do you have any publications?

person beta:
yes. i wrote a thesis entitled" on interpersonal relations in the socialist market economy" and it was published in china daily.

person alpha:
hit'em high, hit'em low. class of'93-- let's go!

person beta:
hi there, everyone. we hope you're having a good night!

person alpha:
wasn't that football game great! i just knew we'd win!

person beta:
the night is young, folks. get some food and mingle with those faces from yesterday.

person alpha:
later we'll let you know who the king and queen of the reunion will be.

person beta:
but for now, the band is playing the songs from our senior year. get out on that dance floor!

person alpha:
excuse me. can you tell me how to get to city hall?

person beta:
yes. go to the next corner and turn left onto center street. walk three blocks to second avenue and turn right. walk two more blocks and you'll see city hall on the left.

person alpha:
i'm sorry. i didn't follow you. could you please repeat that?

person beta:
okay. first, go to the next corner and turn left onto center street.

person alpha:
uh-huh.

person beta:
then, walk three blocks to second avenue an turn right. are you with me so far?

person alpha:
yes. i'm following you.

person beta:
then, walk two more blocks an you'll see city hall on the left. have you got all that?

person alpha:
yes. now i've got it. thank you very much.

person beta:
what's up?

person alpha:
nothing much, what's going on?

person beta:
i'm having a party this friday.

person alpha:
oh, really? that's nice.

person beta:
i wanted to see if you wanted to come.

person alpha:
this friday? sorry, i already have plans.

person beta:
doing what?

person alpha:
i'm going to dinner with my family.

person beta:
i really wanted you to come, but i understand.

person alpha:
yeah, maybe next time.

person beta:
i'll hold you to that.

person alpha:
sounds like a plan.

person beta:
i find that you spend little on handset charge every month. have you any trick?

person alpha:
it's simple. you can use call transfer.

person beta:
is it so simple?

person alpha:
sure. you know, we spend most of our time at home or in the office every day, so i receive handset calls with the hand-free telephone, so i need pay little for receiving calls.

person beta:
it's true.

person alpha:
call transfer has many other advantages. when i am in places where network can't cover, such as the high building, i also use call transfer function, which transfers my calls to the hand-free telephone and i will not miss any call.

person beta:
that's all?

person alpha:
in hospitals or on planes, handsets will interfere with some equip-ment, so we must close our handsets. if you set call transfer, the problem will be solved.

person beta:
are you doing anything tomorrow morning? i'm wondering if you'd like to come to my office to discuss the new project.

person alpha:
tomorrow morning? what about tomorrow afternoon?

person beta:
then i'll see you in the afternoon.

person alpha:
ok.

person beta:
hello, i want to apply for the position of an usher in your restaurant.

person alpha:
welcome. one of your duties is to know the number of the customer and accept reservation.

person beta:
what else do i need to do?

person alpha:
you inform the people in charge and let them reserve dinning tables for guests.

person beta:
i'm going to be moving out soon.

person alpha:
you still have time on your lease.

person beta:
there's no way that i can stay here.

person alpha:
that's not going to be all right.

person beta:
i don't understand why.

person alpha:
i'm going to have to keep your deposit

person beta:
why can't i have it back?

person alpha:
because you're leaving before your lease is over.

person beta:
you have to give it back to me.

person alpha:
you're not going to get it.

person beta:
but i'm not able to live here anymore.

person alpha:
i can't help you with that.

person beta:
can i have my check, please.

person alpha:
here it is. 350 yuan all together.

person beta:
may son adores my new hairstyle so i suppose it is worth it.

person alpha:
hearing you say that is a big reward for us. and here is the receipt.

person beta:
thank you.

person alpha:
wait! congratulations! you are the lucky customer of our anniversary celebration.

person beta:
wow, it's surprising. so what do i get?

person alpha:
you can have a free facial and then make up free for you. do you want it now?

person beta:
probably not. doing that will probably take another three hours which i can't afford now.

person alpha:
here is our number. call us when you are ready to come.

person beta:
you mean i should make an appointment ahead of time?

person alpha:
yes.

person beta:
got it. bye for now.

person alpha:
can i borrow this magazine from you? it's really interesting and i can't put it down.

person beta:
i am sorry, but i can't lend it to you now, for i haven't finished reading it. if you don't mind, i can lend you some back numbers to you.

person alpha:
that would be very kind of you. by the way, is it a monthly magazine?

person beta:
no, it is a fortnightly. so, you see, i can get the new one quite soon.

person alpha:
do you use an anti-virus program to protect your computer?

person beta:
yes, i do. i also use an anti-spyware program and a firewall. there are so many nasties on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users. you have to be very c

person alpha:
how often do you run your anti-virus program?

person beta:
i usually run it every few days. it finds a virus about half the time.

person alpha:
which anti-virus program would you recommend?

person beta:
have you tried this one? it's very good and you can download it for free on the internet. you can also download updates for free.

person alpha:
that sounds very good. which website should i visit to download it?

person beta:
just a minute... go to this one. i'll send you an email with the line in it. it only takes a few minutes to download. then you have to go through the set up procedures. but they are not complicated.

person alpha:
what do you use your computer for?

person beta:
i use it for several things-surfing the net, word processing and creating presentations. i don't play many games on my computer, but i do a lot of work with photographs. using a computer program, you

person alpha:
computers are great, aren't they? i should download some programs and learn how to use them.

person beta:
a:: you must be wily. it's nice to meet you.

person alpha:
b:: nice to meet you, mr. wilson.

person beta:
a:: tim, please. please be seated.

person alpha:
b:: thank you.

person beta:
a:: so, wily, you have been with ibm for two years, ready for change?

person alpha:
b:: well, i think i'm ready for new challenges.

person beta:
hello. could you have a taxi pick me up before 10:00 a. m.?

person alpha:
what is your address?

person beta:
i stay at no. 115 fucking road.

person alpha:
ok, a taxi will be there by 9:30.

person beta:
what are your rates?

person alpha:
it is rib 10 yuan initially and 2 yuan for each kilometer.

person beta:
i have a lot of luggage. will those fit in the taxi?

person alpha:
take it easy. i'll send a larger to pick you up.

person beta:
thank you very much.

person alpha:
hello mr waterstone, what can i do for you today?

person beta:
hello, becky. well, you see, i have this thing here, called a fixed deposit certificate, and i've just noticed the date on it.

person alpha:
oh, i see. you have two choices here you can either redeem or renew.

person beta:
i think i'll redeem, if that's not a problem.

person alpha:
no problem at all, mr waterstone. any preference as to how you want the money?

person beta:
anything you like, but not too many large notes. it's useful to have smaller notes.

person alpha:
here we go, mr waterstone. here's your money and your interest note.

person beta:
yes, yes. everything's fine. thank you very much, becky.

person alpha:
what can i do for you, young man?

person beta:
i need to rent three pairs of skates for the morning.

person alpha:
what sizes do you need?

person beta:
one pair of 37, and two pairs of 21. one for me, and the other two for two kids.

person alpha:
here you are. and here are three crash helmets.

person beta:
thanks. well, those two kids are beginners. what should i do about their safety?

person alpha:
well, there are a lot to do, but nothing to worry about. first, make sure they don't go far from the railings.

person beta:
oh, yeah, maybe i should ask them just to walk along the railings.

person alpha:
that's a good idea. and remind them to be slow at the beginning, not to run into the railings.

person beta:
ok. anything else?

person alpha:
never go to the center of the lake. the ice there is too thin to skate on.

person beta:
got it. thanks for reminding me. and, are there any intensive training courses?

person alpha:
excuse me sir. may i come in?

person beta:
mike, you're late again.

person alpha:
i'm sorry, but my sister was ill, so i

person beta:
do you think i believe the story like that?

person alpha:
but it's true.

person beta:
how can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week?

person alpha:
that's coincident.

person beta:
ok, hold it. remember to be punctual next time.

person alpha:
i promise i will.

person beta:
you'd better.

person alpha:
honey, i have something important to say.

person beta:
something important?

person alpha:
yes. i have just booked two tickets.

person beta:
tickets? what tickets?

person alpha:
two air tickets.

person beta:
air tickets?

person alpha:
yes. we will fly to paris the day after tomorrow.

person beta:
we? the day after tomorrow? what are you talking about?

person alpha:
today is june 18, isn't it?

person beta:
yes. so?

person alpha:
think about it!

person beta:
then it is june 20 the day after tomorrow.

person alpha:
yes. think about it carefully.

person beta:
oh, come on. tell me please. why did you book tickets to paris?

person alpha:
oh, honey! don't you remember this important day to us?

person beta:
sorry.

person alpha:
it is our 10th wedding anniversary this june 20.

person beta:
our 10th wedding anniversary?

person alpha:
of course. you completely forgot it.

person beta:
darling. i think you have made a mistake.

person alpha:
i have made a mistake?

person beta:
yes. we married on july 20 ten years ago.

person alpha:
july 20? but i think it should be june 20.

person beta:
yes. we had planned to marry on june 20, but something happened, so we had to put off our wedding day.

person alpha:
yes. i remember now. we put it off. i did make a mistake. but how shall we deal with the tickets?

person beta:
since you have booked. then let's celebrate our wedding anniversary before hand.

person alpha:
do you want some dessert?

person beta:
no, thank you. check, please.

person alpha:
wait a moment. i will calculate it for you. your bill comes to$ 36.

person beta:
here are$ 40. keep the change. that's my tip for you.

person alpha:
food is less expensive in a cafeteria, because you serve yourself.

person beta:
how to do it?

person alpha:
just pick up a tray, then put a knife, a fork, a spoon and a paper napkin on it and stand in the line.

person beta:
how long will it take to reach the buffet?

person alpha:
not long, because people rush for lunch.

person beta:
the line sure does move fast.

person alpha:
tell the man behind the counter what you want.

person beta:
ok. i like that green vegetable but i don't know how to call it.

person alpha:
just point to it if you don't know the name.

person beta:
all right.

person alpha:
hey, did you hear about jessica's party this weekend?

person beta:
yeah, but i'm still waiting for my invitation.

person alpha:
oh really? she gave me mine earlier today.

person beta:
well, she'll probably just give me my invitation later on today.

person alpha:
yeah, so are you planning on going?

person beta:
i think so. it sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun.

person alpha:
it really does, i can't wait.

person beta:
what time does the party start?

person alpha:
it starts at 8 o'clock.

person beta:
oh, well, how many people has she given invites to so far?

person alpha:
i'm not sure, but i don't think she's given out that many.

person beta:
well, hopefully she'll give me my invite later on today.

person alpha:
after the financial crisis, many industries are in incredibly cloudy situations. how do you think about our company?

person beta:
the outlook in the future is very positive. because we have been in this field for hundreds of years and we know how to survive this crisis safely.

person alpha:
as the department i am applying for is expanding, i would like to contribute by effort.

person beta:
great. welcome to our company.

person alpha:
farmer's pet store.

person beta:
can you please tell me where you are located?

person alpha:
sure, we are off singing road, close to the bank.

person beta:
thank you, i know where that is.

person alpha:
hi, bob, this is john lin.

person beta:
hello, john.

person alpha:
i'm with hartford public relations. i'd like to set up an appointment to come by and talk with you about our services.

person beta:
how about tomorrow at 11 o'clock?

person alpha:
hey, tom, did you enjoy your lunch?

person beta:
oh, don't mention it. it was terrible.

person alpha:
what'the matter?

person beta:
the food station was as crowded as usual. i waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich, and when i finally got it the chicken was underdone.

person alpha:
i see. you simply can't blame the server for this.

person beta:
yes, i know. fast food is so popular in this district.

person alpha:
that's true.

person beta:
anyway, how was your such, catherine?

person alpha:
it was good. i brought lunch from home today.

person beta:
you did? i thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in america.

person alpha:
well, i personally don't like them because i don't believe that they are healthy.

person beta:
i guess you're right. more often than not, people go there only for convenience. the foods may taste good, but generally speaking, they are high in calories, salt and fat.

person alpha:
yes. i am wondering that you must believe fast food is our lifestyle, don't you?

person beta:
you bet. almost all top brands such as mcdonald's and kfc are from america.

person alpha:
well, actually two-thirds of americans may avoid these places.

person beta:
seriously?

person alpha:
yeah, it's hard to believe but true.

person beta:
have you seen this news article? apparently an organization has made a list to name the new seven wonders of the world and people could vote for them online.

person alpha:
wow, that's really interesting. so who won?

person beta:
well, the great wall of china, the taj mahal in india.

person alpha:
i've been there! it really is an amazing work of architecture and art. the entire complex is made of white marble and in the interior of the tomb, the walls are covered with gems and emeralds!

person beta:
cool! also amongst the winners is petra, in jordan, mach pitch in peru and the pyramid in chichenitza in mexico.

person alpha:
wait a minute! it also says that the christ re-deemer statue in brazil and the colosseum in rome are wonders. i would love to go to italy and see the colosseum, stand in the middle like a gladiator!

person beta:
well, let's see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the year.

person alpha:
good idea!

person beta:
hello, i'd like to reserve a hotel room.

person alpha:
that should be no problem. may i have your full name, please?

person beta:
my name is john sandals.

person alpha:
hello, mr. sandals. my name is michelle. what days do you need that reservation, sir?

person beta:
i'm planning to visit new york from friday, april 14 until monday, april 17.

person alpha:
our room rates recently went up. is that okay with you, mr. sandals?

person beta:
how much per night are we talking about?

person alpha:
each night will be$ 308.

person beta:
that price is perfectly acceptable.

person alpha:
wonderful! do you prefer a smoking or nonsmoking room?

person beta:
nonsmoking, please.

person alpha:
next question, is a queen-size bed okay?

person beta:
that sounds fine.

person alpha:
okay, mr. sandals. your reservation is in our computer. all we need now is a phone number.

person beta:
certainly. my phone number is 626-555-1739.

person alpha:
thank you, mr. sandals. we look forward to seeing you in new york!

person beta:
good evening, pizza house. this is marty speaking.may i take your order?

person alpha:
um yes. i'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni, olives, and extra cheese.

person beta:
we have a two-for-one special on large pizzas.would you like a large pizza instead?

person alpha:
sure, that sounds good.

person beta:
great! would you like your second pizza to be the same as the first?

person alpha:
no, make the second one with ham, pineapple and green peppers. oh, and make it thin crust.

person beta:
okay, thin crust. your total is$ 21.50 and yourorder will arrive in thirty minutes or it's free!

person alpha:
perfect. thank you. bye..

person beta:
wait!! i need your address!

person alpha:
hello, personal banking. how may i help you?

person beta:
hi there. i'm calling about personal internet banking, what details can you give me?

person alpha:
personal internet banking is a self service financial service that is based on the internet. it can be used by both businesses and individuals. we offer an online payment service, personal net banking, which includes services such as account transfers, personal foreign exchange trading. you can also get account management services, online bill payment, for household bills like gas and electricity...

person beta:
that sounds good. at the moment i spend ages queuing at the post office to pay my bills.

person alpha:
i was surprised to see how few people you have on-site. you provide a wide range of goods and services but have a very small workforce.

person beta:
it depends on the time of year. at peak times we hire in casual workers to help with packing and dispatch. we also contract out certain services all year round, for example, cleaning. we run a very tight operation!

person alpha:
do you handle the recruiting yourselves?

person beta:
sometimes we use a local employment agency. it depends on the job.

person alpha:
jeff, look at this listing! it says there is a cozy studio apartment for rent, and it's only$ 700 per month. what do you think?

person beta:
well i think i can afford that apartment. but are pets allowed?

person alpha:
hmm... let me look. yes, it says it's a pet-friendly building.

person beta:
that's great. that means i can bring my cat, mr. twinkles. where is the apartment located?

person alpha:
it says it's located in the suburbs.

person beta:
what would you like to have for dinner? chicken or beef?

person alpha:
chicken, please.

person beta:
good choice!

person alpha:
what kind of drinks do you have?

person beta:
well, we have all kinds of beverages in addition to fruit juices.

person alpha:
in that case, let me have a glass of orange juice.

person beta:
anything else?

person alpha:
i would like to have some tea as well.

person beta:
another flight attendant is coming down the aisle with coffee and tea.

person alpha:
i see.

person beta:
i'd like to apply for a credit card. can you help me with my application?

person alpha:
i'd be glad to.

person beta:
i'm afraid that i don't have a credit history. i just came to this country.

person alpha:
do you have an account with this bank?

person beta:
i'm afraid not.

person alpha:
in that case i highly recommend you apply for a savings and checking account also. that would help with your credit card application.

person beta:
what is the interest rate on your card?

person alpha:
the annual charge rate is 9.5%.

person beta:
that's very expensive!

person alpha:
not really. the credit card is a revolving account. you only pay interest on what you owe.

person beta:
how does the bank bill its customers for credit card charges?

person alpha:
you will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized.

person beta:
does the card provide any other benefits?

person alpha:
you can also get a cash advance up to 1,000 dollars on this card.

person beta:
you're really fit, paul. do you exercise very much?

person alpha:
well, i almost always get up very early, and i lift weights for an hour.

person beta:
you're kidding!

person alpha:
no. and then i often go rollerblading.

person beta:
wow! how often do you exercise like that?

person alpha:
about five times a week. what about you?

person beta:
oh, i hardly ever exercise. i usually just watch tv in my free time. i guess i'm a real couch potato!

person alpha:
i don't believe we've met.

person beta:
no, i don't think we have.

person alpha:
my name is gao run.

person beta:
how do you do? my name is james green.

person alpha:
here's my name card.

person beta:
and here's mine.

person alpha:
it's nice to finally meet you.

person beta:
and i'm glad to meet you, too.

person alpha:
marketing manager's office. can i help you?

person beta:
mr. smith, please.

person alpha:
sorry, he is out.

person beta:
what time do you expect him back then?

person alpha:
sorry, i am not sure. can i take a message?

person beta:
no, thanks. i will call back later.

person alpha:
that's fine. please call again later.

person beta:
ok. thank you. goodbye.

person alpha:
can i help you?

person beta:
yes, i need some traveler's checks.

person alpha:
how much do you need?

person beta:
three thousand us dollars.

person alpha:
all right, can i have your passbook?

person beta:
yes, here you go.

person alpha:
what amounts do you want the checks in?

person beta:
it's all the same to me.

person alpha:
here you are.

person beta:
thanks.

person alpha:
the plumbing in my new apartment is not working.

person beta:
i need you to tell me what the problem is.

person alpha:
the bathroom sink is stopped up.

person beta:
is the kitchen plumbing messed up also, or just the bathroom plumbing?

person alpha:
just the bathroom plumbing seems to have a problem.

person beta:
did this just start happening, or has it been going on for a while?

person alpha:
everything worked beautifully until a few hours ago.

person beta:
are you going to be home so i can come by and take a look at the problem?

person alpha:
i am not sure if i will be home later.

person beta:
i will be coming by around 10 this morning. if you aren't there, i'll just use my key.

person alpha:
grand theft auto three is awesome!

person beta:
it's more violent than tv news!

person alpha:
what time is it anyway?

person beta:
nine-thirty.

person alpha:
oh, my god, three hours already! i have to get the chores done!

person beta:
no time. that's their headlights in the window!

person alpha:
ok, emergency measures. let's throw the dishes in the trash! two birds with one stone...

person beta:
little dude, your life is over!

person alpha:
no time to worry. we have to dispose of this evidence.

person beta:
how old is keith?

person alpha:
he's 21. how old is james?

person beta:
he's a year older than keith, but he looks younger.

person alpha:
how's your father?

person beta:
he's fine. he retired last week. it's a turning point in his life. now he can relax and enjoy his retirement.

person alpha:
he can spend more time with his grandchildren.

person beta:
oh, i don't think he wants to. he wants to travel to several different countries around the world.

person alpha:
so, he wants to have a more active retirement. good idea!

person beta:
how do you want to spend your old age?

person alpha:
in the same way, probably.

person beta:
could you do me a favor and proofread my resume before i send it out to the human resources department?

person alpha:
sure, let me take a look... personal information, education, experience, training... i think you should add another section for language. you speak three languages, so you might as well put that on your resume.

person beta:
but languages don't have anything to do with engineering. shouldn't everything i put on my resume have something to do with my field?

person alpha:
not necessarily. i think people would be impressed by your language abilities. it says something about your level of intellect and experience. also, i think human resources directors want to see more of a well-rounded person in a resume.

person beta:
it's just a piece of paper, you think that they can tell if i am a well-rounded person by looking at it?

person alpha:
well, you're right, the resume is limited in how much it can tell someone about a person. that's why job interviews are important to let people know the real you that they can't see from a piece of paper. but resumes can be helpful in explaining things and giving a good impression to a potential employer.

person beta:
why not come over to work in my company?

person alpha:
i need to think it over.

person beta:
tell me what you need.

person alpha:
all right. i'm prepared to, if the pay is reasonable.

person beta:
we are approaching the top of the mountain.

person alpha:
what a beautiful view we have here.

person beta:
yes, you can have a bird's-eye view of the whole city.

person alpha:
wonderful. will we have any free time there?

person beta:
of course. we will stay there for half an hour and you can do your own business.

person alpha:
what did you do last night?

person beta:
i just stayed at home and watched tv.

person alpha:
did you watch the barcelona versus madrid game?

person beta:
yes, it was a very evenly matched game.

person alpha:
what were the results of the game?

person beta:
it ended in a tie.

person alpha:
what was the actual score?

person beta:
it was three all.

person alpha:
really? i thought barcelona was going to win. they are a much better team than madrid.

person beta:
if barcelona had played as they normally do, they should have won.

person alpha:
what happened?

person beta:
their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal, but he kept on playing anyway.

person alpha:
that explains it.

person beta:
how many more games are left this season?

person alpha:
that was the last game before the playoffs.

person beta:
when do the playoffs start?

person alpha:
in a few weeks. are you planning on watching them?

person beta:
of course! i really love watching football games on tv.

person alpha:
me, too! do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place? i'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together.

person beta:
sure, that would be great.

person alpha:
ok, it's a date then!

person beta:
how are you?

person alpha:
i'm fine, thanks. just trying to get adjusted. it's hard to keep track of everything around here.

person beta:
that's for sure. you're new, too, huh?

person alpha:
yeah. i just got here a couple of days ago. how about you?

person beta:
excuse me. i bought this shirt yesterday, but i would like to refund it.

person alpha:
gave me the receipt, please.

person beta:
here is my receipt.

person alpha:
what's wrong with it?

person beta:
it's too small for me to wear.

person alpha:
would you like another bigger one?

person beta:
no thanks. i want to have a refund.

person alpha:
ok, here is your money.

person beta:
oh, so many kinds of winter hats.

person alpha:
what is your favorite color, miss?

person beta:
red.

person alpha:
here you are.it's very attractive.

person beta:
may i try it on?

person alpha:
go ahead.

person beta:
is there a mirror around here?

person alpha:
right over there.

person beta:
does it suit me?

person alpha:
yes, you look very nice.

person beta:
how much is it?

person alpha:
we're having a clearance sale.$ 4 plus tax.

person beta:
that's quite reasonable.

person alpha:
what can i help you with?

person beta:
may i ask you something?

person alpha:
what's your question?

person beta:
how many hours behind the wheel do i need?

person alpha:
what do you need to take it for?

person beta:
i'm trying to get my license.

person alpha:
you need six hours.

person beta:
can i do all six hours in one day?

person alpha:
you have to do it in three days.

person beta:
that's all i have to do?

person alpha:
that's everything.

person beta:
well, that's a relief.

person alpha:
excuse me, i have something to trouble you.

person beta:
yes? i'll be very glad if i could be of any help to you.

person alpha:
an hour ago, i bought this vase with my tourist.

person beta:
oh, yes. i remember it clearly. is there anything wrong with it?

person alpha:
i'm afraid so. we found this crack on the bottom when i went back to my hotel.

person beta:
oh, how awful! let me have a look, i'm terribly sorry. it was most thoughtless of me. would you excuse me, please?

person alpha:
oh, it's quite all right, i suppose. it can't be helped sometimes.

person beta:
it's very kind of you to say so. how about changing another one for you?

person alpha:
all right. thank you.

person beta:
just a minute, please. i won't be long. i'm sure this one is perfect. you may examine it carefully.

person alpha:
oh, yes, it is. i'll take this one.

person beta:
i'm very sorry for any inconvenience i've caused you.

person alpha:
well, there's no reason to apologize for such a trifle thing.

person beta:
here you are. you left the medicine here.

person alpha:
sorry. i was too worried.

person beta:
i firmly believe that you love your brother very much.

person alpha:
absolutely. by the way, do you sell any traditional chinese medicine?

person beta:
yes, we have some chinese medicine for common cold.

person alpha:
i heard chinese medicine has a better lasting effect in cure.

person beta:
it depends. it's true that you can take some for prevention.

person alpha:
what kind of place shall we rent?

person beta:
it should be close to the university. neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is, the later we can get up.

person alpha:
absolutely. that's the most important thing to take into consideration. i'm not too worried about the size of the flat.

person beta:
neither am i. so a small place is ok, but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive. do you mind if it's in a noisy area?

person alpha:
i don't mind. i'm not a light sleeper, but quieter is better for when we have to study at home.

person beta:
good point. ok, let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us.

person alpha:
yes, if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days. i think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early.

person beta:
how much do you think the rent will be?

person alpha:
i asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month.

person beta:
i have a terrible toothache.

person alpha:
which tooth is it?

person beta:
this one here.

person alpha:
ar, yes. there's a big cavity.

person beta:
can you fill it?

person alpha:
i'm afraid not. the tooth is too far gone. it'll have to be taken out.

person beta:
then i might as well have it done now.

person alpha:
you'd better wait, the gums are swollen. take the medicine i prescribe and come back in three days.

person beta:
may i have a look at that vase, please?

person alpha:
of course. it's the best one i have here---and it's only 300 yuan.

person beta:
oh, it's really nice, but to tell the truth, that's far too expensive.

person alpha:
really? even for such an excellent one?

person beta:
can you tell me the best way to look for an apartment?

person alpha:
the local newspaper has ads for housing.

person beta:
is there any way to find a roommate to share an apartment with?

person alpha:
sometimes you can post an advertisement saying that you need a roommate.

person beta:
what do landlords charge for rent?

person alpha:
would you like an apartment for just yourself, or do you need it for two people?

person beta:
there are two of us, but we only need a one-bedroom apartment.

person alpha:
you should be able to easily find that for twelve hundred dollars a month.

person beta:
i really would appreciate it if you could come look at apartments with me.

person alpha:
sure, i'll go look at apartments with you anytime you want.

person beta:
excuse me, would you please do me a favor?

person alpha:
with pleasure.

person beta:
i appreciate the building so much. i am wondering if you could take a picture of me against the building.

person alpha:
no problem.

person beta:
the product's selling points is its advanced technoledge.

person alpha:
unfortunately, it's just too expensive for majority of consumer to afford.

person beta:
why is the price so high?

person alpha:
it's not just that the price is high, it's that the overhead to update an entire computer system to be compatible is costly.

person beta:
model of computers aren't compatible?

person alpha:
most current computer systems simply can't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities.

person beta:
maybe after the next generation of technology comes out, the price of this model will become more affordable.

person alpha:
but by then, the technology will be outdated.

person beta:
true, but our focus has never been affordability anyway. coastwise, we may not be very competitive, but qualitywise, we definitely have an edge.

person alpha:
that's right, no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable.

person beta:
this model has advanced technoledge, superior components, it is compact, and it's a top-quality product.

person alpha:
i guess you get what you pay for.

person beta:
what kind of permanent would you like to have?

person alpha:
what kinds do you have?

person beta:
oh, yeah, it's quite of variety. regular, cold perm, straight perm, pink curl and form.

person alpha:
last time i tried a pink curl perm and form permanent. set the wave a little loose than as usual, please.

person beta:
hello! how do i get more amenities?

person alpha:
i'm sorry, sir. i'm not sure i understand.

person beta:
i'm talking about the free stuff, like soap and shampoo.

person alpha:
oh, i see. so, you're saying that you've already run out of your amenities.

person beta:
no, no. i've got plenty left.

person alpha:
now i'm confused again! what is the problem?

person beta:
what am i going to do about souvenirs?

person alpha:
oh, i get it! you want souvenirs!

person beta:
yes, i've got enough soap for my use, but no extra soap for souvenirs.

person alpha:
sir, our souvenir shop carries all those items, and as a guest you get a discount.

person beta:
please! free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs.

person alpha:
i understand completely, sir. housekeeping will bring you souvenirs in just a moment.

person beta:
excuse me. is this where i catch the bus for the zoo?

person alpha:
well, you can take the no. 36 bus from here, but then you have to walk about 30 minutes.

person beta:
that doesn't sound too bad.

person alpha:
actually, if you go to the bus stop in the next block, you can take bus 301 which will let you right off in front of the zoo.

person beta:
maybe that's what i'll do. thanks a lot.

person alpha:
you're welcome.

person beta:
i'd like to order breakfast, please.

person alpha:
what'd you like, madam?

person beta:
two muffins and a cup of coffee.will it take long?

person alpha:
no, just a few minutes.

person beta:
how are you?

person alpha:
i'm doing well.

person beta:
how may i help you?

person alpha:
could you cancel a check for me?

person beta:
what's the problem?

person alpha:
i wrote the check out for way too much.

person beta:
how much?

person alpha:
i wrote the check out for$ 150.

person beta:
what were you supposed to write it out for?

person alpha:
i was supposed to write the check out for$ 100.

person beta:
i'll just cancel it for you right now.

person alpha:
that's great. you're a lifesaver.

person beta:
would you like to take a look at the menu, sir?

person alpha:
yes. thank you.

person beta:
would you care for a drink before you order?

person alpha:
a glass of qingdao beer.

person beta:
yes, sir. i'll bring it over. have you decided what you'd like, sir?

person alpha:
will you make some recommendation?

person beta:
i'm taking ba fright 123 to london. can you tell me where the reporting desk is, please?

person alpha:
yes, madam. the reporting desk for the british airway's flight to london is over there.

person beta:
thank you so much. is this the desk for ba flight 123 to london?

person alpha:
yes, this is the right desk. have you any luggage?

person beta:
the suitcase, that's all. except my handbag. of course.

person alpha:
would you please put you suitcase on the scales? you needn't weigh your handbag.

person beta:
is there a receipt?

person alpha:
yes. i'll attach your baggage receipt to your ticket.

person beta:
what must i do next?

person alpha:
you must go to immigration to the departure lounge.

person beta:
it's time for bed.

person alpha:
but i'm not sleepy, mum. can i stay and watch more tv?

person beta:
it's already half past eleven. you have school tomorrow. you'll sleepy all tomorrow, if you don't sleep well tonight.

person alpha:
i know. but i promise i won't be sleepy tomorrow. i work really hard.

person beta:
don't you have the exams coming up soon? i'm sure you could spend more time preparing for those.

person alpha:
oh, i nearly forgot the exams.

person beta:
you do well in maths, but your history is not good enough. am i right?

person alpha:
yeah, i guess so. maybe i can go to sleep now and get up early to review the lessons tomorrow.

person beta:
an excellent idea. work now and play later.

person alpha:
i know you're right. school is more important than tv. can i watch one more show, then go to bed.

person beta:
no, now it's bedtime.

person alpha:
yes, madam? can i help you?

person beta:
oh, yes, please. but you are just closing, aren't you?

person alpha:
well, yes, we are, madam. the shop shuts down in five minutes.

person beta:
i shall not keep you long then. it was about some saucepans you had in your window last week.

person alpha:
last week, madam? i really can't remember which ones you mean. what were they like?

person beta:
oh, they were lovely. sort of imitation wood, dark brown color, country-style you know, and the lids, if i remember rightly, they had a sort of leaf pattern, or was it flowers?

person alpha:
that's strange. i don't recognize any of the ones we had from that description. are you sure they were in this shop?

person beta:
oh, you must know the ones i mean. they were on sale, a real bargain. reduced to a quarter of the original price. i couldn't believe my eyes when i saw them.

person alpha:
i am afraid the sales are over now, madam. and you know we all sold out of the saucepans.

person beta:
i don't think you did, you know. my neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday.

person alpha:
well, it's all new stock in the window now.

person beta:
may i just have a look, to see if there is anything else?

person alpha:
eh, well, madam, as you know we are closing.

person beta:
yes, yes, i am sorry i won't keep you. it must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time. but they were such beautiful saucepans. i'd have bought them if i had made up my mind on the spot.

person alpha:
perhaps madam, if you come back tomorrow, i could show you the whole range of kitchen ware. and there are still one or two things at the sale price.

person beta:
oh, look! that was the one there. that is the sort of thing i was looking for. but it's not quite the color.

person alpha:
that might be the artificial lighting, madam. of course, if you could come back in daylight, you might find it's exactly what you are looking for.

person beta:
there it is. that is the pattern! the set behind you. thank goodness, they haven't been sold. and thank you so much for being so patient with me. yes, those are the ones.

person alpha:
i've come to hear about your offer.

person beta:
we have the offer ready for you. let me check. 10 boxes with 50 brooches per box, at 20,000 yuan; 20 boxes with 50 waistbands per box, at 30,000 yuan; 15 boxes with other ornaments per box, at 7, 500 yuan, for shipment in june. the offer is valid for five days.

person alpha:
i can tell you right now that your prices are a little higher than we expected.

person beta:
you know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years. the prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where.

person alpha:
i am afraid i can't agree with you there. i must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies.

person beta:
but you must take the design and quality into consideration. you know we are superior to others in design and quality. we have various styles, which the other companies cannot catch up with.

person alpha:
i agree that yours are of the top.

person beta:
well, since your order is large enough, can you give me a rough idea?

person alpha:
to have this business concluded, i should say a reduction of least 10% would help.

person beta:
impossible. how about 5% off?

person alpha:
right. a reduction of 5% is acceptable.

person beta:
so i'm on the fifth floor? how come this hotel has no fourth floor.

person alpha:
four is an unlucky number here, peter.four sounds like death in chinese.hotels often have no fourth floor.

person beta:
i see.oh, i know what i wanted to ask.how much should i tip this guy?

person alpha:
people don't usually tip here, but you can.fifty dollars should be more enough.

person beta:
hello! this is ruby speaking from g. o. t. international travel agency. what can i do for you?

person alpha:
i'd like to make a reservation for my trip from detroit to beijing on april 13 on trans pacific airline.

person beta:
do you want a single ticket or a round trip ticket?

person alpha:
i'd like to have a round trip ticket with a one-year open return.

person beta:
economy or business class?

person alpha:
economy, please. how much is it?

person beta:
it will be$ 850.

person alpha:
very good. could i get an electronic ticket? i'm always afraid of losing my tickets.

person beta:
no problem. how do you wish to pay for it?

person alpha:
bank of american card. the number is 6786 9182 12300 8657.

person beta:
thank you! would you like an aisle seat or a window seat?

person alpha:
an aisle seat, please. i'm tall and need to get up and walk pretty often.

person beta:
no problem. your ticket is for trans pacific flight 87 from detroit to beijing at 3 forty p. m. on april 13. you will arrive at beijing international airport at six 35 p. m. on april 14. your electronic

person alpha:
what time should i arrive at detroit airport?

person beta:
please be at the airport two hours before your departure to check in. you also need to reconfirm your reservation with the airline at least 7 days prior to your departure.

person alpha:
what happens if i can't leave on april 13? can i cancel my ticket or change the reservation to another date?

person beta:
yes, you can, but you will have to pay a penalty of$ 75 for any change or cancellation.

person alpha:
that's ok. what are the weight restrictions for checked baggage?

person beta:
on trans pacific international flights, each ticketed passenger is permitted a maximum of two checked bags with a maximum weight per checked bag of 70 pounds.

person alpha:
that's great! i can have two bags checked for 70 pounds each. i think i'm all set. you're really efficient. thank you very much for your help.

person beta:
thank you for the compliment and for calling g. o. t. travel agency. have a nice trip!

person alpha:
i do want to meet with you and take a look at your catalogue. we're redecorating and are going to add some things.

person beta:
well, i'll be glad to help you out. i can come out anytime on tuesday or thursday of next week.

person alpha:
let's put it down for 1:15 on thursday. we'll definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit.

person beta:
fine. i'll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogues on thursday.

person alpha:
that looks graceful on you.

person beta:
thank you.but it is too bright for me.

person alpha:
how about this brown one?

person beta:
let me try it on. i like that color.

person alpha:
ok, i will get one for your.here you are.

person beta:
but it is too loose.do you have the smaller size?

person alpha:
sorry, it had been sold out.

person beta:
what a pity!

person alpha:
i'd like to apply for a personal loan.

person beta:
how much would you like to borrow?

person alpha:
a thousand dollars.

person beta:
let me check with a credit manager. a record show your credit reading is quite high. i don't think you have any problems.

person alpha:
what's the current interest rate?

person beta:
our monthly interest is 1.5% of the outstanding balance. would you please fill out the application the form?

person alpha:
and there's a little upside-down dilbert on the underside.

person beta:
when you flip the tie up, he's right side up. brilliant.

person alpha:
my dad will love this. he's a dilbert fan.

person beta:
i wouldn't mind having one myself...

person alpha:
model it for me.

person beta:
ok!

person alpha:
wow! you look just as dorky as dilbert!

person beta:
welcome. what can i do for you, madam?

person alpha:
i hope you can give me some advice. i'm sick and tired of coming here or to the post office to pay my utility bills. it's such a long way from my home, but i checked and you are my nearest branch. is there anyway i can do it from home?

person beta:
that's terrible. unfortunately, we don't have that many branches outside the centre of town. what i'd advise you to do is set up a direct debit service.

person alpha:
a direct debit service? what's that exactly?

person beta:
a direct debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account, no fuss, no hassle.

person alpha:
but how will you know how much i should pay? i mean, i receive my bills, not you.

person beta:
we set up an agreement with the, say, phone company. they tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account. of course, we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies.

person alpha:
i see. so, that would mean that every month it would just come from my account? that does sound like a good idea, totally trouble free.

person beta:
hello.

person alpha:
hi. it's tony calling from the dentist's office. is lily there?

person beta:
no, lily is not here at the moment.

person alpha:
could you ask her to call me back when she gets in?

person beta:
sure. what's your number, please.

person alpha:
519 367 8901.

person beta:
thanks. and your name is tony, right?

person alpha:
yes. i'm tony. thank you very much.

person beta:
you're welcome. bye.

person alpha:
bye.

person beta:
so what do you think of my new dress?

person alpha:
i think it's great! i really like the color, and it goes really well with your eyes. i've actually been eyeing that dress at maxine's for a while now, but i wasn't sure i could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment.

person beta:
um, ninety-five dollars?

person alpha:
yes, that's the price they were advertising it at. i was hoping it might go on sale soon. why, how much did you pay for it?

person beta:
i bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at helen's boutique. i didn't know i could get it cheaper somewhere else.

person alpha:
of course! everything at helen's is overpriced, and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store! why didn't you shop around?

person beta:
i don't know, i just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much i wanted it. i guess i was too impulsive.

person alpha:
who gave my dog this cooked chicken bone?

person beta:
i did. why?

person alpha:
didn't you know dogs shouldn't eat cooked chicken bones because they're bad for their stomachs?

person beta:
no, i didn't. i'm sorry. it won't happen again.

person alpha:
is it fred's fault?

person beta:
no, i don't suppose he's to blame.the man in the other car made a mistake.

person alpha:
but he's equally responsible because he tried to overtake you.

person beta:
in foreign trade, exporters have to adjust their product in a timely manner.

person alpha:
how to adjust?

person beta:
exporters must ensure that their product satisfies customers'needs, wants and likes.

person alpha:
ah, some products are successful at home, but not be popular overseas.

person beta:
that's because the fashion, taste and social customs and so on vary considerably.

person alpha:
yes, sometimes the differences are great.

person beta:
well, we should be in accordance with national conditions and adjust the product.

person alpha:
we have to ensure that the product should be attractive to guarantee sales.

person beta:
i hate doing the damn laundry.

person alpha:
watch your language.

person beta:
i want to buy three tickets. what's the entrance fee?

person alpha:
$ 10 per person.

person beta:
here are$ 30. by the way, where can i find a guide?

person alpha:
turn to the next window and they will help you find one.

person beta:
thanks a lot.

person alpha:
shall we share a taxi?

person beta:
where are you heading now?

person alpha:
i want to go back to my college on the huanghe road.it is very close to your house.

person beta:
is that the university next to the teachers'college?

person alpha:
that's the one.

person beta:
you mean we'll share the taxi?

person alpha:
yeah.if we share the cab, it'll be cheaper.besides that your chinese is better than mine.the drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though i practice my pronunciation carefully.

person beta:
well.don't worry about it, i will be happy to share the taxi with you.

person alpha:
good morning.are you mr.liu?

person beta:
my name is liu lichi. how do you do?

person alpha:
how do you do? please be seated, how is your trip here?

person beta:
quite good, i think. i came here by bus, and it took me about 15 minutes.

person alpha:
oh, yes.how old are you?

person beta:
twenty.

person alpha:
hum, still a student?

person beta:
yes, i'm student of grade 3 in the university majoring in economics.

person alpha:
what subjects are you studying?

person beta:
english, math, commercial and legal studies, and accountancy.

person alpha:
have you had any working experience.

person beta:
well, i worked at a supermarket during last summer holidays.

person alpha:
what do you like to do in your spare time?

person beta:
i like sports very much.besides that, i also like working on a computer in my spare time.

person alpha:
how are your english and computer skills?

person beta:
i have passed the cet- 4 and 6.as far as computer is concerned i can use the computer for word processing.

person alpha:
okay. mr.liu, we'll inform you of the results within a week.

person beta:
that dress is very pretty. why don't you like it?

person alpha:
it's too loud.

person beta:
we've been looking around for many hours.what on earth are you looking for?

person alpha:
well, you know, those styles or colors don't suit me.

person beta:
what style do you want?

person alpha:
i want to buy a v-neck checked sweater, and it should be tight.

person beta:
oh, i see.how about the color?

person alpha:
quiet color.

person beta:
i know a shop selling this kind of sweaters.

person alpha:
really? let's go there.

person beta:
hey julie, you want to go grab something to eat?

person alpha:
sure! what do you feel like having?

person beta:
i really feel like having a big juicy steak!

person alpha:
oh. ok. i don't eat meat, but that's fine, i am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right?

person beta:
i didn't know you were a vegetarian!

person alpha:
i'm not, i am a vegan.

person beta:
a what?

person alpha:
a vegan. i don't eat or use any animal based products. i don't wear leather, eat eggs, drink milk or anything that comes from an animal. i used to be a pescatarian before, which basically means you don't eat meat, but still have fish and seafood.

person beta:
wow! that's interesting! it must be tough!

person alpha:
it's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes, but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays, it's getting a bit less difficult.

person beta:
how do you feel about that restaurant?

person alpha:
it wasn't all that great.

person beta:
what did you dislike the most?

person alpha:
i don't think that they had their act together. they didn't seem well prepared.

person beta:
did you think that the food was any good?

person alpha:
i wasn't all that impressed by the food.

person beta:
the service certainly could have been better.

person alpha:
the service did not help the situation.

person beta:
is this a restaurant that you want to come back to?

person alpha:
i am not interested in trying this restaurant again.

person beta:
let me see your passport. is london your final destination?

person alpha:
no. i am a transit passenger going to sweden.

person beta:
how long are you going to stay here?

person alpha:
only one night.

person beta:
do you have any dutiable items?

person alpha:
no, i don't.

person beta:
what are these?

person alpha:
they are my personal effects.

person beta:
i heard that you finished my home inspection, and i was wondering how it went.

person alpha:
first of all, we need to understand what i was looking for. do you know what the purpose of an inspection is?

person beta:
i am not sure what a home inspection is all about.

person alpha:
i went there to check for problems with the home, so you aren't surprised when you move in.

person beta:
wouldn't the owners have told me about any problems?

person alpha:
sellers aren't always truthful, and there might also be problems that they aren't aware of.

person beta:
can i require the owners to fix the problems?

person alpha:
you can make the sale of the house contingent on them fixing the problems.

person beta:
what did you find out when you did the inspection of my new home?

person alpha:
there were no major problems. one leaky pipe under the sink and two broken roof tiles was all that i found.

person beta:
how you celebrate your valentine's day with your wife?

person alpha:
i will take a rain check.

person beta:
yesterday i had a quarrel with my roommate. i'm really fed up with all this.

person alpha:
tell me what seems to be the problem.

person beta:
my roommate always brings a lot of friends from off-campus. they stay in the room until midnight, singing and talking, drinking and playing cards while i have no place for study. i even don't have the quietness to sleep.

person alpha:
did you ever talk to him about it?

person beta:
what can i do for you today?

person alpha:
i have a question.

person beta:
what do you need to know?

person alpha:
i need to take the driver's course. how many hours do i need?

person beta:
it depends on what you're trying to do with the completion of the course.

person alpha:
i need to get my license.

person beta:
you're going to need to complete six hours.

person alpha:
how many hours a day can i do?

person beta:
you can do two hours a day for three days.

person alpha:
that's all i need to do to finish?

person beta:
yes, that's all you need to do.

person alpha:
thanks. i'll get back to you.

person beta:
would you like your bags to be taken to your room?

person alpha:
yes, please.

person beta:
ok. i'll get the bellman to taka them up. which bags are yours?

person alpha:
my luggage is in the corner over there. they are the leather suitcase, the canvass holdall and the blue backpack.

person beta:
ok.

person alpha:
please be careful with the suitcase, it's very heavy.

person beta:
i'll let the bellboy know. don't worry, he's very strong.

person alpha:
and the holdall has some fragile items inside, so please be careful with that too.

person beta:
of course.

person alpha:
how far do we have to go?

person beta:
about 50 miles.

person alpha:
the traffic is not very heavy on this high way, is it? so i'm sure we'll make it.

person beta:
no, but we've got a hurry. it will be the rush hour soon.

person alpha:
don't worry. there's plenty of time yet.

person beta:
but it's friday today. this road is always jam packed during the weekend, isn't it?

person alpha:
right.

person beta:
hello! i'm sorry to bother you. this is a complimentary fruit tray. your food will be ready soon.

person alpha:
wow! it's a fruit sculpture! your chef is a real artist!

person beta:
actually, uh, i made it myself...

person alpha:
you did? wow! where did you learn...

person beta:
sorry, but i've gotta run. enjoy your food, and ring the service button if you need anything else!

person alpha:
how can we develop a new brand image with no direction whatsoever?

person beta:
with the fifty forwards he sent out today, maybe we'll inadvertently get inspired.

person alpha:
i guess this is a good excuse to surf the net on someone else's dime.

person beta:
who'd have thought bean would be this kind of e-mail fanatic?

person alpha:
he must have just got online for the first time last week. he still thinks it's some kind of new toy.

person beta:
okay, so we're agreed on 900.

person alpha:
i'm happy with that price.

person beta:
let's shake on it.

person alpha:
okay, let's shake on it.

person beta:
may i help you?

person alpha:
give me a big mac, a small order of french fries and a medium coke.

person beta:
you'll need to wait a few minutes for the fries. they are still in the fryer.

person alpha:
that's fine.

person beta:
your total comes to$ 7.

person alpha:
here's a twenty. could you give me some more napkins?

person beta:
sure. your cash back is$ 13. and we'll bring out your fries in two minutes.

person alpha:
thanks.

person beta:
let me tell you some more. the interest is settled on the 20th of the last month in each quarter, it's paid quarterly. of course it also needs to be settled if you cancel the account.

person alpha:
miao ping, in your opinion, should we go for the type a or type b account?

person beta:
well, the type b account is very restricted. if your aim is to use the account the same way as your use your settlement account, i would recommend the type a account for you.

person alpha:
thanks for your time. i'll go and discuss everything with my partner and i'll be back later.

person beta:
sarah, you don't look so good. what's the matter?

person alpha:
i've got a really bad headache and my stomach hurts.

person beta:
it sounds like you're coming down with something.

person alpha:
excuse me, could you give me change for a dollar?

person beta:
i'll see what i have. what do you need it for?

person alpha:
i want to get cigarettes.

person beta:
you can use quarters, dimes and nickels.

person alpha:
hi. i'm here to catch flight 513 to new york.

person beta:
may i see your ticket please?

person alpha:
here you are. do you need to see my passport?

person beta:
any form of picture i. d. will do.

person alpha:
mmmm... a photo i. d. i have my new jersey driver's license. is that ok?

person beta:
that will do. what an interesting picture! how old is it?

person alpha:
actually it wad taken just last year, but i had a shaved head and a beard. can you still recognize me?

person beta:
barely. will you be checking any luggage today?

person alpha:
yes, one suitcase. i also have a carry-on bag.

person beta:
ok. mr. lee, you're all set. your flight leaves from gate 10. boarding begins at 10:30

person alpha:
which university did you graduate from?

person beta:
i graduated from peking university.

person alpha:
what was your major at university?

person beta:
i studied economics, i am especially interested in the economic development of china.

person alpha:
what course did you like best?

person beta:
i like business management, and i think it's very useful for the present work.

person alpha:
what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you've taken and the job you are seeking?

person beta:
i've taken courses on office administration, reports and correspondence writing. i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager, because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork.

person alpha:
marco has fallen off a ladder. i think he's hurt his back. what shall we do?

person beta:
we'd better not move him. i'll get the first-aider.

person alpha:
have you ever shopped online?

person beta:
quite often. it is very convenient, saving me a lot of time.

person alpha:
do you have some experiences to share with me? i want to have a try.

person beta:
you are asking the right person. here are two very important tips. first, you need to visit no more than one site to find the best products and prices. i can recommend you some online merchants. second, write your mail address correctly. otherwise, you can't receive your delivery in time.

person alpha:
what about the registration procedure? is that complicated?

person beta:
not at all. you just need to provide your name, address, e-mail address, phone number and bank or credit card information. i will help you with that.

person alpha:
it is so nice of you.

person beta:
hey, you look great! how's everything?

person alpha:
yeah, you know what? i've been going to the club regularly. the training really pays off. now i am in a good shape and i know more about how to keep fit.

person beta:
really? tell me about it. i haven't gone to the club for a long time. i am too busy with work.

person alpha:
it's important to do proper exercises.

person beta:
you're right. too much or too little won't do any good.

person alpha:
the trainer tells me, besides regular sports activities, i should also have a healthy and balanced diet.

person beta:
sounds reasonable.

person alpha:
we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic.

person beta:
and fruits!

person alpha:
surely it is. getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness.

person beta:
i've heard that. does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit?

person alpha:
yeah, he advises me to stay in a good mood. that can also help one to keep sound physical health.

person beta:
i think if you follow your trainer's advice, you'll be on the right track.

person alpha:
you bet it!

person beta:
what's your main range?

person alpha:
generally speaking, we provide bikes for both gentlemen and ladies, size 19, 21, 23, 25 and 27 inches. we can vary the colors according to the buyer's requirements. here are the catalogues and the pattern books. they will give you a rough idea about our products.

person beta:
i am interested in your flying pigeon bicycles. i think some of these items will find a ready market in canada. but what our customers appreciate most is a reliable product.

person alpha:
to be reliable is the strong point of our products. as a matter of fact, it's always our practice to supply high quality goods at reasonable prices. flying pigeon is the best of its kind at the price.

person beta:
then i'd like to know your availability of the products and the terms of sales, such as mode of payment, delivery, discounts, etc.

person alpha:
i have learnt how to ride a bicycle. i plan to go to the water park by bike this weekend.

person beta:
well, you know, the traffic in beijing is sometimes dangerous. therefore, i have to remind you of something. first, you should obey the traffic rules, don't break in the red light. second, don't play a joke with your friends when riding on the bike. third, do not hurry up when riding, or would make an accident. finally, remember come on the left and go on the right!

person alpha:
oh, my dear sister, i am no longer a baby!

person beta:
you have a lovely house, jack.

person alpha:
thank you. but a number of things have been going wrong lately.

person beta:
that's too bad. what problems are you having.

person alpha:
oh, the whole house needs re-painting for starters. the carpet in the living room is worn out, and i'd like to put in new wall-to-wall carpeting. last week, i had to call the plumber to fix the toilet. anyway, all par for the course when you own a house, i guess. i think i am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over.

person beta:
i've studied home decoration as a hobby. could i make some suggestions?

person alpha:
go right ahead.

person beta:
well, i think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room, and maybe some new drapes for the windows. also, a grandfather clock would look great in the den. perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room

person alpha:
wow, you really do have a talent for this, alice. thanks for the suggestions.

person beta:
you are welcome, jack. glad to be of help.

person alpha:
hello, mrs.white! i'm anne.

person beta:
nice to see you with us, anne.please make yourself at home.

person alpha:
thank you.you're so considerate.

person beta:
do you have sport shirts for ladies?

person alpha:
there are different types. which one do you like best?

person beta:
i think the red one fits me well. can i try it on?

person alpha:
surely, of course.

person beta:
where is the fitting room?

person alpha:
it's there, near the mirror.

person beta:
i'm a little nervous.

person alpha:
don't worry. you'll be fine. first of all, put on your seat belt. adjust the mirrors.

person beta:
you don't think i'll need the seat belt, do you?

person alpha:
of course not. but it's a good habit to put it on every time you drive.

person beta:
just in case, right?

person alpha:
right. hold the steering wheel with your hands at ten o'clock and two o'clock.

person beta:
good morning, sir. where are you going?

person alpha:
i'm going to england by flight be987.

person beta:
when is your flight?

person alpha:
10:00 am. when am i supposed to check in?

person beta:
we are checking in. may i have your ticket and your health certificate and your luggage please.

person alpha:
here you are.

person beta:
are you keeping the small bag as carry-on luggage, sir?

person alpha:
yes.

person beta:
you must weigh that as well.

person alpha:
all right.

person beta:
your luggage is two pounds over. i'm afraid they'll be in excess luggage charge, sir.

person alpha:
how much must i pay?

person beta:
it's ten yuan.

person alpha:
here you are.

person beta:
this is your luggage check which you must show when you disembark at your destination and here is your boarding pass and your ticket.

person alpha:
thanks.

person beta:
now, please wait until your flight is called. there's about twenty-five minutes to go.

person alpha:
i'm a little nervous. i've never flown before.

person beta:
there's nothing at all to worry about. once you are in the air, it's just like sitting at your sitting room. it's going to be a very pleasant flight.

person alpha:
good evening, ma'am. table for one?

person beta:
yes, please.

person alpha:
will this table be all right?

person beta:
actually, i'd like a booth by the window if that's possible.

person alpha:
certainly. how about this one?

person beta:
this will be fine, thanks.

person alpha:
( handing her a menu) your waiter will be here in a minute to take your order.

person beta:
thank you.

person alpha:
i have puzzled my brain about how to teach the children.

person beta:
what is your problem?

person alpha:
my children can never be obedient even if i criticized them severely.

person beta:
you need not always do that. why don't you pat them on the back occasionally?

person alpha:
can i have the window seat over there?

person beta:
sorry, sir. that table has been booked.

person alpha:
well, in that case, this table is the only choice.

person beta:
actually you can have a window seat if you don't mind a ten-minute wait.

person alpha:
there is no need. thanks.

person beta:
i'm hungry.

person alpha:
so am i.

person beta:
where should we go eat today?

person alpha:
how about we go eat in the cafeteria?

person beta:
i never bought food from the cafeteria.

person alpha:
you haven't? they have a lot of good stuff.

person beta:
what do they have?

person alpha:
they sell everything.

person beta:
well, i want chinese food.

person alpha:
i've gotten chow mein from there before.

person beta:
i guess we can eat there then.

person alpha:
trust me, the food isn't half bad.

person beta:
hi, who has the remote control?

person alpha:
i do. why, do you want me to change the channel?

person beta:
yes, please. i can't stand watching the channel any more.

person alpha:
i think they have pretty good programmes. but i'll change it if you really want.

person beta:
put it on channel 5, ok?

person alpha:
oh, i hate channel 5. i'd rather just listen to the radio.

person beta:
don't make such a fuss. i'm sure you will like today's programme.

person alpha:
what's on today?

person beta:
a basketball match between chinese team and american team.

person alpha:
really? i'm interested in it.

person beta:
it might begin now.

person alpha:
i am calling to find out why i didn't receive an unemployment check this week.

person beta:
did you send in your continued claim form for the last period?

person alpha:
i think i forgot to send it in!

person beta:
you need to be very careful to send that form in every two weeks if you want to get paid.

person alpha:
can i send it in now?

person beta:
you should look at your claim form and see if it has been more than fourteen days since it was due. if it hasn't been, we will still accept it.

person alpha:
can i mail it in early next time so it isn't late?

person beta:
actually, you cannot mail it in early, as it needs to reflect all of the information up to the due date.

person alpha:
will my paycheck come right away now?

person beta:
your check will arrive a little late.

person alpha:
excuse me, are you mrs. green from england?

person beta:

person beta:
i don't know. i just know i've never been asked so many questions in my life.

person alpha:
how many of them were there?

person beta:
three-but there was one of them who kept asking really stupid questions.

person alpha:
like what?

person beta:
oh, he wanted to know what time i got up this morning and if i bad a bath or a shower you know, things like that.

person alpha:
what on earth has that got to do with some money disappearing?

person beta:
i've no idea. oh yes, and the most ridiculous thing. he asked me what i had for breakfast this morning.

person alpha:
oh well, that's it. they obviously think you're a desperate criminal and you have to steal to eat. i should think you'll get thirty years.

person beta:
hmm. thank you very much.

person alpha:
what a mess!

person beta:
sorry. i'll clean it up.

person alpha:
what can i do for you?

person beta:

person beta:
8 hours. tokyo is 8 hours earlier than london.

person alpha:
it's one day more or one day less from tokyo to london?

person beta:
one day more.

person alpha:
it means that we will arrive on the same day.

person beta:
yes.

person alpha:
shall we visit the summer palace tomorrow?

person beta:
good. i don't want to leave beijing without visiting it.

person alpha:
how far is it from our hotel?

rockefeller center.

person beta:

person beta:
thank you. i'm sure you will.

person alpha:
i hope so. thank you for saying so.

person beta:
excuse me, could you help me pick out a lotion?

person alpha:
sure, what is the problem?

person beta:
i got poison oak while hiking, and i need something to help me with the itching.

person alpha:
i can suggest a product called techne that comes in a lotion or cream.

person beta:
which do you prefer?

person alpha:
hikers tell me that the cream is best because it stays on longer.

person beta:
is there anything else i can do to help with the itching?

person alpha:
you can take an antihistamine.

person beta:
thank you so much for all of the information.

person alpha:
you are welcome. please feel free to ask me a question any time you need help.

person beta:
abby park hotel. can i help you?

person alpha:
yes, i would like to book a room for my wife and myself.

person alpha:
we will be arriving on tuesday next week and staying for two days.

person beta:
we have a double room for you with a nice view of the park. would that be ok?

person beta:
i'm sorry. i have no idea. i haven't seen that for ages.

person alpha:
sir what's the boarding time?

person beta:
i am sorry.the flight is late.please go to the waiting room for further notice.

person alpha:
i don't want to miss my flight.

person beta:
don't worry. we will keep you well informed.

person alpha:
thank you.

person beta:
( a stranger stops to help) everything ok?

person alpha:
no! my tour bus got a speeding ticket not ten minutes ago. now my engine is on fire!

person beta:
i think that's just steam. your engine's overheated.

person alpha:
do you know a lot about cars?

person beta:
a little bit. i'll take a look if you want me to.

person alpha:
please. thank you so much for stopping.

person beta:
yeah, she's hot. radiator's leaking. looks like you were running her pretty hard.

person alpha:
that must have been just before i got the speeding ticket.

person beta:
did you have an accident recently... hey, wait a second! i know this car!

person alpha:
you do?

person beta:
i ran into it a couple of weeks ago. what do you know? name's hal.

person alpha:
i'm akimbo. nice to meet you, i guess.

person beta:
boy, i'm sure sorry about your car. hey, akimbo, i wonder if you'd like to make a deal?

person alpha:
what kind of deal?

person beta:
i'd like to give you cash for the damage to your car.

person alpha:
you don't want your insurance company to pay for it?

person beta:
i'd rather not. they'll raise my rates. it'll cost me more in the long run.

person alpha:
if you give me cash, do you care if i don't fix the car?

person beta:
hell, i don't care. just don't submit a report to your insurancecompany.

person alpha:
it's a deal, hal. thanks again for stopping to help. and thanks for smashing my car!

person beta:
our benefits usually include medical insurance, public accumulation fund and allowances.

person alpha:
what are the allowances?

person beta:
if you go on a business trip, you will enjoy the allowance. it is 200 yuan per day.

person alpha:
well, i see. and what about the vacation in our company?

person beta:
as a new-comer, you usually have five days of annual vacation. and remember you have to fill out a request form, if you want to ask for leave.

person alpha:
will our company have some recreational activities?

person beta:
of course. in spring and autumn, we will hold some sports actives. and in movie seasons, we bulk purchase film tickets.

person alpha:
i will take it. how much?

person beta:
$ 60.

person alpha:
i am sure you can do better than that.

person beta:
sorry, sir. it's the sale price.

person alpha:
well, what about$ 70 with a scarf?

person beta:
it's my rock bottom price. take it or leave it.

person alpha:
good afternoon, sir. have you made a reservation?

person beta:
i am afraid not. are there any vacant tables?

person alpha:
i don't think so. you have to wait for about 10 minutes.

person beta:
that's all right.

person alpha:
i am calling to consult you about the job as a copywriter.

person beta:
yes, what do you want to know?

person alpha:
the information is scanty for me. and can you describe the responsibilities of the position?

person beta:
yes. copywriters are supposed to design and write articles for the advertising company.

person alpha:
how would you like your hair set?

person beta:
i'd like to have it in big waves.

person alpha:
shall i put some oil on? b

person beta:
hello, jack. i'm john.

person alpha:
i'm glad to see you!

person beta:
sit down, please. maybe you have read the contract, but i want to give you the details again before you sign the contract. you must have a three-month internship.

person alpha:
yes, i know.

person beta:
when you become a permanent employee, you will have the insurances. you will get monthly pay and will be on eight-hour/ day work shift.

person alpha:
wait, will i have five insurances and one fund?

person beta:
yes. you can also enjoy legal holidays and year-end bonus.

person alpha:
it sounds great!

person beta:
if you need to work overtime, you will get twice the usual salary as overtime pay.

person alpha:
ok.

person beta:
you have read the relevant terms of the contract. do you have other questions?

person alpha:
how long will the induction training be?

person beta:
about two weeks.

person alpha:
i see.

person beta:
if you don't have other questions, just sign here.

person alpha:
ok.

person beta:
hi, i'm george. i'll be your waiter this evening. are you ready to order or do you need a few more minutes?

person alpha:
i'm ready now. i'd like the roast chicken and a side order of corn.

person beta:
and would you like an appetizer before your meal? the soup of the day is our delicious tomato soup.

person alpha:
i'll pass on the soup, but i'd like a garden salad.

person beta:
can i get you anything to drink?:

person alpha:
yes, i'd like a glass of iced tea.

person beta:
okay. i'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad.

person alpha:
thank you.

person beta:
do you want to help me make the cookies, anna?

person alpha:
i'd love to.

person beta:
first, put away your toys.

person alpha:
ok.

person beta:
i'll get the flour out.

person alpha:
let me help you.

person beta:
we have made some adjustment on the prices. and this is renewed price list.

person alpha:
thank you for allowing us 3% reduction, but still we find your price is on the high side.

person beta:
this is our rock-bottom price, and we can't make any further reduction.

person alpha:
if so, we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks.

person beta:
then what's your counter-offer?

person alpha:
this is our counter-offer.

person beta:
we are sincere to make business with you, but the difference between your counter-offer and our price is too great.

person alpha:
so are we. our counter-offer is in line with the world market.

person beta:
how about meeting each other half-way in order to conclude the business?

person alpha:
agreed.

person beta:
what do you usually have for breakfast? pancakes or waffles?

person alpha:
i usually have cereal for breakfast.

person beta:
but isn't it served with cold milk?

person alpha:
yeah. cold milk wakes me up.

person beta:
chinese people don't like to eat cold food.

person alpha:
is that right?

person beta:
but i'm open to new things. i'll have a bowl of cereal, too.

person alpha:
with cold milk?

person beta:
with cold milk!

person alpha:
i am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful. we just made a record sale this season.

person beta:
that is very encouraging news. i heard that the marketing department has done a three months research, they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month. that is to say, the r& d center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market.

person alpha:
it is not an easy job. how do you like the advertisement for the new product?

person beta:
that is the best one i have seen. i am sure our target customers, young people will love it.

person alpha:
certainly.

person beta:
hi, i need to copy something right now.

person alpha:
our computer lab on the first floor has a copy machine, sir.

person beta:
great! how much per copy?

person alpha:
sir, one copy is ten cents.

person beta:
okay, i'll be down there shortly.

person alpha:
you probably won't have to wait for anyone, sir.

person beta:
hi, ellen. that outfit looks terrific!

person alpha:
thanks, jim. i didn't think guys paid attention to stuff like that.

person beta:
no, we just don't usually admit it!

person alpha:
well, thanks for the compliment anyway!

person beta:
this olympic park is so big!

person alpha:
yes. now we are in the olympic stadium, the center of this park.

person beta:
splendid! when is it gonna be finished?

person alpha:
the whole stadium is to be finished this june.

person beta:
how many seats are there in the stand?

person alpha:
oh, there are 5000 seats in total.

person beta:
i didn't know it would be so big!

person alpha:
it is! look there, those are the tracks. and the jumping pit is over there.

person beta:
ah... i see. hey, look the sign here, no climbing.

person alpha:
we put many signs with english translations for foreign visitors.

person beta:
it's located in the suburbs? well even though that sounds like a steal, i really want something downtown.

person alpha:
ok. well the problem is that the apartments in the heart of the city are usually more expensive.

person beta:
i know, that's my problem. what do you think i should do?

person alpha:
well, maybe you could get a two-bedroom apartment downtown and share the rent with a roommate.

person beta:
oh, great idea!

person alpha:
so, monica, how do you like your new office?

person beta:
well, i love it. the room is spacious and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine. there are plants along the corridor. especially, i got my own desk with computer and telephone. such a great place!

person alpha:
that's very good. i once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful.

person beta:
what was so bad about it?

person alpha:
small rooms, small window, a small desk shared by three people. i would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work.

person beta:
sounds bad! lucky you! you didn't take that job. i think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently.

person alpha:
totally agree. by the way, the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506. you can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor.

person beta:
now, if i look here i see that you completed a ba in english?

person alpha:
yes, that's right. after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk. my major was english, and my minor was business studies. i completed my ba in 2004.

person beta:
yes, i'm pleased to see that you also got a distinction.

person alpha:
yes that's right. i've always enjoyed studying. my friends say i'm a bit of a bookworm, but my father always pushed us to succeed academically.

person beta:
well, it looks like his encouragement paid off rebecca. so how about extracurricular activities at university?

person alpha:
well i've always been keen on writing, so i became the editor for the university student magazine, which i really loved. also i volunteered for a group called shelter, to help the homeless in york.

person beta:
what did that involve?

person alpha:
providing warm meals and shelter, especially in the winter months. i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group.

person beta:
i'm sure. okay, now let's move on to your work experience, shall we?

person alpha:
yes, okay.

person beta:
could you change these for me, please?

person alpha:
what would you like?

person beta:
twenties and some smaller bills, please.

person alpha:
anything else?

person beta:
yes. could you tell many balance? here's account number.

person alpha:
now, what seems to be the trouble?

person beta:
it's nothing serious. but i always have a headache, and i haven't slept properly for several weeks. i've also lost appetite and my eyes are burning.

person alpha:
mm, you do look rather pale. let me take your temperature. would you put the thermometer under your arm, please? now, let me listen to your pulse. mm, do you feel weak?

person beta:
yes, i never seem to have any energy.

person alpha:
i'll give you a blood test. would you roll up your sleeve? just as i thought. you're anemic. you'd better pay more attention to your diet. eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and food high in protein. and don't stay up late working. try to get more rest.

person beta:
thank you.

person alpha:
excuse me, i would like to know something about this campus. right now it seems very big and confusing! i have no idea where i am going or what i am doing.

person beta:
do you have a map of the campus?

person alpha:
yes, i have, but it doesn't help me very much. i'm not very good at reading maps.

person beta:
do you know where your classes are?

person alpha:
more or less. i go to three different buildings, and always get there late. i feel so hopeless. i don't know why i am late all the time. no one else seems to be.

person beta:
that's because you don't know the short cuts. you'll learn them after a while. i can show you the ropes.

person alpha:
good morning, i would like to reserve a berth.

person beta:
which train do you like?

person alpha:
t112 to washington please.

person beta:
may i have your name?

person alpha:
that's lincoln.

person beta:
will you be voting?

person alpha:
i can't wait to vote.

person beta:
who are you voting for?

person alpha:
the person i'm voting for is the best.

person beta:
what do you like about him?

person alpha:
he is very intelligent.

person beta:
you think so?

person alpha:
that's right. plus, i agree with his policies.

person beta:
i'm glad to hear that you are so excited.

person alpha:
i'm voting for the next president.

person beta:
i'm sure he will be.

person alpha:
i'm going to make sure and vote.

person beta:
good morning. may i help you?

person alpha:
yes, i'd like to check out now. my name's adams, room 312. here's the key.

person beta:
one moment, please, sir.... here's your bill. would you like to check and see if the amount is correct?

person alpha:
what's the 14 pounds for?

person beta:
that's for the phone calls you made from your room.

person alpha:
can i pay with traveller's cheques?

person beta:
certainly. may i have your passport, please?

person alpha:
here you are.

person beta:
could you sign each cheque here for me?

person alpha:
sure.

person beta:
here are your receipt and your change, sir. thank you.

person alpha:
thank you. goodbye.

person beta:
what type of people do you work with most effectively?

person alpha:
i tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward.it's more difficult for me to be around timid people, because i move quickly and i am decisive.

person beta:
what things impress you in your colleagues?

person alpha:
i admire and work best with people who are of good character and integrity. i also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment.

person beta:
what are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked?

person alpha:
the only thing i really don't like is to get feedback in front of others. i want to hear good and bad feedback in private, so that i have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions. i believe that's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior.

person beta:
how do you organize and plan for major projects?

person alpha:
i love to brainstorm a best, worst, and most likely scenario.then, i set a timetable that's realistic.what i usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because i've already visualized what could happen and how i'd react.

person beta:
describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure.

person alpha:
i had to complete an end of quarter report once while i was on the road for two consecutive weeks.the amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible, because i could't bring my office files with me.luckily i had a great secretary and a logical filling system, so we located everything we needed.

person beta:
how do you manage your time in a typical day?

person alpha:
i've always given priority to work with established clients, because they offer a better risk/ return value.the last thing i do is general correspondence, especially internal correspondence, which i take care of at the end of the day or week.

person beta:
describe a time when you acted on someone's suggestion.

person alpha:
i changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings.

person beta:
did you get bean's ten different good luck forwards, like that one from the dalai lama?

person alpha:
yeah, i deleted all that superstitious crap. what a waste of bandwidth!

person beta:
i figured i might as well send one or two of them out. maybe my luck will get better.

person alpha:
do you really think the dalai lama sent that? i'm tired of all these forwards.

person beta:
it's worth a shot. maybe we'll get some luck in thinking up something for this case.

person alpha:
i am sorry to have kept all of you waiting. i was delayed by something urgent.

person beta:
you are not late, mr. thomas. there're still 15 minutes to go. mr. white has just called you.

person alpha:
what did he say?

person beta:
he said there was a traffic jam, but he is coming.

person alpha:
he shouldn't drive his car. he should come here by bus.

person beta:
want to send out for some chinese?

person alpha:
some what?

person beta:
some chinese food. i'm hungry, and there's a take-out restaurant near here. we can have them deliver and then watch the news on tv while we eat.

person alpha:
no, i'd rather go out. the chinese food here is rather different from what i had at home. maybe we can try some other food today... what about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day, the one over in the shopping center?

person beta:
okay. i could go for that. it's called al's steakhouse. they also have great fried fish, and i love their salad bar. you can go back to refill your plate as often as you like.

person alpha:
is that the place that serves such large portions of meat?

person beta:
yes, their steaks are enormous. sometimes i can't finish what i've ordered.

person alpha:
what if that happens to me? i hate to let food go to waste.

person beta:
don't worry. we'll just get a doggie bag.

person alpha:
do you get the news that our company is trying to find out new tactics to test us?

person beta:
i know something about it. our company often organizes all kinds of lectures to improve our professional skills.

person alpha:
it takes most of our weekends to listen to these boring lectures, so i can not bear it anymore. it is said that they think out some tests to check our management skills.

person beta:
is that true?

person alpha:
definitely!

person beta:
if that information is exact, i guess our company is willing to promote someone.

person alpha:
hello sir, how may i help you?

person beta:
i would like to buy some flowers, please. something really nice.

person alpha:
i see, may i ask what the occasion is?

person beta:
it's not really an occasion, it's more like i'm sorry.

person alpha:
very well.this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends. it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out. it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness.

person beta:
i think i'm gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear. what else do you recommend?

person alpha:
mmm, well this is our i'm sorry i cheated on you package. two dozen red roses lined with tulips, carnations and lilies. the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you.

person beta:
i don't think that's gonna cut it. i need something bigger and better!

person alpha:
i'm sorry sir but, what exactly did you do?

person beta:
well, i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier.

person alpha:
get out of my store, you jerk!

person beta:
i have to get to chicago by tomorrow and you're telling me that there are no flights?

person alpha:
i'm very sorry, sir. i could put you on a waiting list, but you would be wise to check out other means of travel.

person beta:
you mean like a bus? have you ever traveled for ten hours on a bus before?

person alpha:
i have not sir. but i do have a number for a very comfortable bus that goes to chicago every hour from here.

person beta:
alright, give me the number. but put me on that waiting list as well.

person alpha:
here is the number, and your name is on the waiting list.

person beta:
how many people are on the waiting list right now?

person alpha:
right now i show that there are 176 people on the list. and you are number 176.

person beta:
how do you think they could be ended?

person alpha:
i don't think that there is any easy way. the united nations could send peacekeepers into the country. at least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate.

person beta:
so, if the cause is poverty, there should be a program to make the country richer.if the problem is resources, share them.

person alpha:
it sounds easy when you say it like that. in reality, it's harder to make peace between countries.

person beta:
yes, it is.one way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support. wars are very expensive.

person alpha:
you still have not given me those files i've asked you for.

person beta:
i'm sorry, mr. myers. i've just been so busy today.

person alpha:
i really don't want to hear your excuses, janet. we're running a busy office here. you're going to have to keep up.

person beta:
you're right, sir. i apologize. i'll get those files for you now.

person alpha:
what sort of job would you like to take?

person beta:
i prefer a sedentary job and i used to work as an operator.

person alpha:
we need an operator now.

person beta:
it's just the job i've been searching for.

person alpha:
i wish the politicians would quit digging up dirt about each other's past.

person beta:
i know. it really makes a mess of the whole election process.

person alpha:
and it takes up all the news.

person beta:
the problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up.

person alpha:
it's so small. the fact that there is public interest, doesn't say much for us as the public.

person beta:
have you ever listened to am radio? it's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on tv and fm radio.

person alpha:
i don't remember the last time i listened to am radio.

person beta:
another place you can get real insight is european papers. you can get them on-line.

person alpha:
hello, miss wu, this is dan robson calling from otc limited. i'd like to check my last order. when exactly was it sent out?

person beta:
i can check that for you right now. would you mind holding?

person alpha:
sure. no problem.

person beta:
mr. robson, i'm sorry. our computer system is down. could i call you back later?

person alpha:
sure. do you have my number?

person beta:
yes, i have it right here. i'm so sorry about this.

person alpha:
no problem. i'll wait for your call.

person beta:
what are you typing there?

person alpha:
i'm working on my resume.

person beta:
really? did you find any information about a new job?

person alpha:
yeah, i just got some good information off the internet.

person beta:
great! do you think you have a chance at getting the job?

person alpha:
i didn't just find out about one job. there were several ones that looked good.

person beta:
maybe i should try looking on the web for work.

person alpha:
sure you have to be patient. but i think it's much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls.

person beta:
but there must be so many people who also see the advertisement for that job on the net. you might have no chance.

person alpha:
how do you know if you don't have a try?

person beta:
would you please show me the necklace in the window?

person alpha:
is this the one you want?

person beta:
no, the one next to it.

person alpha:
here you are.

person beta:
thanks. what kind of stone is this?

person alpha:
it's a ruby. it is from south africa. would you like to try it on?

person beta:
yes, please. how much is it?

person alpha:
it costs$ 200.

person beta:
it looks good. ok. i'll take it.

person alpha:
happy birthday, jim!

person beta:
thank you, lisa.

person alpha:
here is a present for you. i hope you like it.

person beta:
oh, great! i love it! you know i've been expecting this for a long time.

person alpha:
i'm very glad to hear that.

person beta:
come here, let me introduce some friends to you.

person alpha:
what's wrong with you? you look pale.

person beta:
i'm not sure, i feel hot and cold.

person alpha:
when did the trouble start?

person beta:
i was sick most of the night.

person alpha:
it sounds like you are coming down with the flu. let me take your temperature.

person beta:
have i got a high fever?

person alpha:
yes, thirty-eight point seven. do you have a headache, chest or throat pain?

person beta:
yes, i have.

person alpha:
now, let me have a look at you. i'd like to listen to your chest. now breathe in, a deep breath, that's it cough, now again. i want to examine your throat, too. open wide, say'ah--'

person beta:
aaaaahh, aaaaahh.

person alpha:
yes, it does look a bit sore. let's take an x-ray of your chest and give you a few tests.

person beta:
all right, thanks.

person alpha:
the tests showed nothing wrong. a slight viral infection.

person beta:
what shall i do today?

person alpha:
i'm giving you some antibiotics and aspirins. take an aspirin when you've got a fever, and take one antibiotic capsule every four hours, and go home and rest in bed for two days. drink plenty of water, then you'll feel better. here's the prescription.

person beta:
i have to check out today. i'd like my bill ready by 10 this morning.

person alpha:
you can be sure of that, sir.

person beta:
thank you.

person alpha:
i called hp about my computer.

person beta:
what did they say?

person alpha:
they said i need a new hard drive.

person beta:
that's too bad. how much is a new one?

person alpha:
it's not too much, only about$ 85.

person beta:
plus installation?

person alpha:
no, my hard drive is easy to remove and replace.

person beta:
really?

person alpha:
yes, it's just a couple of screws.

person beta:
that's nice.

person alpha:
it's a lot better than paying someone$ 60.

person beta:
if my hard drive crashes, i'll just call you.

person alpha:
gosh, it's 7:30, i'll miss the first class.

person beta:
don't get up so late next time. you should have gone to bed earlier last night.

person alpha:
yes, mum.

person beta:
is there anything wrong?

person alpha:
i'm worried about my daughter. she can't decide about college.

person beta:
don't worry. that's just a part of being a teenager.

person alpha:
i don't mind that. but she disagrees with me about everything.

person beta:
you should encourage her to make up her mind by herself. you shouldn't affect her decision.

person alpha:
but i just want to give her some tips.

person beta:
oh, she can make her own decisions.

person alpha:
i guess you are right.

person beta:
believe me. everything will be ok.

person alpha:
i hope so.

person beta:
it's beautiful here.

person alpha:
yes. i feel refreshed.

person beta:
how long will we dock?

person alpha:
in half an hour. the surface of the lake is calm.

person beta:
yes. we come at the right time.

person alpha:
that was a really good meal, gordon.

person beta:
it sure was. i couldn't eat another bite.

person alpha:
well, it is getting pretty late. i think we should go home.

person beta:
you're right. i have to get up early to go to work tomorrow.

person alpha:
let's see how much the bill is.

person beta:
don't worry about it. tonight is my treat.

person alpha:
what are you talking about? we'll split the bill.

person beta:
no, i insist. i kept telling you that i would treat you to dinner but i still haven't.

person alpha:
no way, gordon. i know that you are a little short on cash at the moment. there's no need for you to pay for the whole bill.

person beta:
alright, if that's the way you are going to be, we'll split the bill.

person alpha:
that's better. this way we will both have money to take a cab home, otherwise, you would probably have to walk.

person beta:
just promise you will let me treat you to dinner next week, ok?

person alpha:
you've got a deal.

person beta:
great. bye.

person alpha:
bye.

person beta:
i hear you are planning to travel abroad.

person alpha:
yes. i'm going to the untied states for travel. what places do you recommend?

person beta:
in my opinion, there are several places you mustn't miss, like washington d. c, las vegas, new york and los angeles.

person alpha:
someone suggests that i should go to seattle and hawaii.

person beta:
yes, you may consider those two places also. seattle, for example, is worth visiting and there's a very famous museum called museum of flight.

person alpha:
and seattle is the home of microsoft and boeing. that must be a great place. i can't miss it.

person beta:
this looks like a very nice house.

person alpha:
you know, i fell in love with this house the first moment i laid eyes on it.

person beta:
the style of the exterior is just what i've been looking for!

person alpha:
the exterior is only half of the story. the interior is incredible.

person beta:
this home is gorgeous on the inside!

person alpha:
everything that you see on the walls, floors, and windows is brand new.

person beta:
the wall colors totally suit the style of this house.

person alpha:
straight ahead is the gourmet kitchen.

person beta:
i love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops.

person alpha:
the master suite is the best. let's go look at that next.

person beta:
there is plenty of room for our king-sized bed, and i love the light in this room.

person alpha:
i know that you like this house, but let's take a look at the others before you make up your mind.

person beta:
room service.what can i do for you?

person alpha:
l am afraid there isn't any fancy soap in my room.

person beta:
sorry sir, we will bring you one.anything else?

person alpha:
yes.bring me a bath towel as well.

person beta:
good afternoon.british airline.is there any thing i can do for you?

person alpha:
can i make a reservation for flight fw58 to san marino?

person beta:
sure. when do you want to take the plane?

person alpha:
next monday.

person beta:
will that be first class or economy seat?

person alpha:
what's the fare for a first class seat?

person beta:
$ 200.

person alpha:
oh. i am not a wall streeter.give me an economy one please.

person beta:
hello, sir. so, you are back?

person alpha:
yes, hello again. i would like to know the exact difference between dividend deposit and dividend participated deposit.

person beta:
that's pretty easy to explain. with the deposit, the interest is fixed, but the dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year. the longer the term, the higher the dividend you earn. this is because it is calculated at the compound interest rate.

person alpha:
and i can purchase that here?

person beta:
yes. and if you already have a current account with us, the insurance premium can be paid through it, which saves all of us a lot of hassle.

person alpha:
are there any beds vacant?

person beta:
yes, what kind of room do you want?

person alpha:
i prefer one facing the sea. besides, it should have a shower.

person beta:
sorry, right now we can only have you a room without shower.

person alpha:
well, that's fine.

person beta:
welcome to the company. we are conducting a survey of new employees to find out what influenced them to choose our company.

person alpha:
that's easy. it was your office ergonomics that decided me.

person beta:
you're kidding! something as simple as that?

person alpha:
yes. it is very important to me. my mother worked in offices for twenty years, and she finally had carpal tunnel syndrome. i have been reading about repetitive stress injuries, and i know that t

person beta:
yes, there has been a lot of research into rsi's. something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries. tell me, did anything else influence your decision?

person alpha:
yes, i noticed that you have professional training and team-building days. i like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff.

person beta:
well, welcome to the team.

person alpha:
good afternoon. i've brought the extra blanket you asked for.

person beta:
oh, thank you.

person alpha:
is there anything i can do for you now?

person beta:
yes. i'm rather tired and want to go to bed early. please make the bed.

person alpha:
certainly, sir.

person beta:
lin's office supplies. how may i direct your call?

person alpha:
marry lin please.

person beta:
sure, just a moment.... i'm sorry no one answer the phone.

person alpha:
all right, could i leave a message?

person beta:
certainly!

person alpha:
please ask her to call john.

person beta:
excuse me. where is the way out?

person alpha:
well, that's what i'm looking for myself.

person beta:
it's very confusing in here, isn't it?

person alpha:
absolutely. oh, do you see a sign there?

person beta:
it should be the way out.

person alpha:
ok. let's go and see.

person beta:
excuse me, i ordered the well-done steak, but this one is so tough.

person alpha:
well, sir, i think i have made a mistake. i will take it back to the kitchen right now.

person beta:
i think you should be more careful next time.

person alpha:
yes, sir. i'm really so sorry about that.

person beta:
allan, i am really disappointed by your lack of effort on this project.

person alpha:
look, sally. i've put just as much work into this as anybody else.

person beta:
no, i'm sorry. i disagree. i don't think you've been working at full speed at all.

person alpha:
well. i'm sorry you feel that way.

person beta:
hi joe, how are you doing today?

person alpha:
things are going good today. how have you been doing, mary?

person beta:
things are going well for me, joe.

person alpha:
want to go see a movie tonight?

person beta:
my parents are taking me to dinner tonight.

person alpha:
could you go with me to the movies on friday night, instead?

person beta:
what movie did you want to see?

person alpha:
there is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer.

person beta:
i was thinking that i would like to see" the secret life of bees."

person alpha:
oh great! sounds like something i need to bring kleenex to!

person beta:
how's the bride-to-be?

person alpha:
tired and stressed. this wedding is giving me a headache.

person beta:
just relax. with me as your maid of honor, everything will be fine!

person alpha:
i'm worried that everything will be chaotic!

person beta:
hey! i'm the tour guide. i'll take care of the taiwanese guests.

person alpha:
you're going to have to tell them what to do in church, what everything means...

person beta:
i will. don't worry!

person alpha:
jim? jim?... what are you doing in the kitchen?

person beta:
nothing, mummy. i was hungry so i came here for some milk.

person alpha:
milk? i thought you didn't like milk.

person beta:
i don't, but i couldn't find anything to eat in the refrigerator.

person alpha:
nonsense. there's lots of food in the refrigerator... what's behind your back?

person beta:
nothing.

person alpha:
what are you hiding behind your back? let me see.

person beta:
promise that you won't get angry.

person alpha:
ok, i promise. what is it?

person beta:
it's a kitty.

person alpha:
oh, jim. i told you. no pets. it'll make a mess of this house.

person beta:
please, mummy. everybody else in my class keeps a pet. please, i'll take care of it. it's a good kitty. it'll not bring you any trouble.

person alpha:
no way. it might belong to somebody else. you can't keep it here.

person beta:
please, mummy. i found it this afternoon by the garbage bin. it was starving and looking for something to eat. please! you see, it's so cute and tame.

person alpha:
all right. but you have to clean up everything it messes up.

person beta:
i will. thank you, mummy.

person alpha:
i was wondering if you could help me with something.

person beta:
sure, anything you say.

person alpha:
actually, it's a little bit silly.

person beta:
don't worry about it, just ask.

person alpha:
what words do i need to know to buy a pair of shoes?

person beta:
you need to know the type of shoes you want.

person alpha:
don't worry about that. i can point it out in the store.

person beta:
the shoes can be comfortable or not comfortable, too wide, too narrow, or just right; and long or short. in girls shoes, the heel can be high or low.

person alpha:
let me write all that down. i'm going shopping this afternoon.

person beta:
excuse me. how long has it been since the business was founded?

person alpha:
it has been 12 years since it was founded in 1998.

person beta:
so, it has a history for more than a decade?

person alpha:
yes. and it was incorporated with other businesses in 2008 due to the global financial crisis.

person beta:
what can i do for you, madam?

person alpha:
can you help me with comprehensive credit granting?

person beta:
certainly, madam. what would you like to know?

person alpha:
well, everything really.

person beta:
all right. we can grant a financing promise quota, if you qualify. this means that we can deal with all of your needs in a speedy and efficient way. firstly, your credit rating must be class a, and your debt to asset ratio must be top notch, for the industry you are involved in.

person alpha:
let's do something outdoors today.

person beta:
all right. but i don't want to play tennis. we played tennis last weekend.

person alpha:
okay. what do you want to do?

person beta:
i want to go jogging.

person alpha:
all right. that sounds like fun.

person beta:
good afternoon. i come here specially to pick up my tickets. i booked it last month.this is my reservation note.

person alpha:
i am terribly sorry. you didn't come to reconfirm recently.you should have come to pick up your ticket three days ago since it's an international flight, any reservation without reconfirmation within 72 hours will be cancelled.

person beta:
but i have been so busy all these days.well, is there any other ticket available? i want the next one.

person alpha:
the last thing to be ignored at a chinese dinner table is to keep modest.

person beta:
does that suggest diners avoid speaking much? the same is true in the west.

person alpha:
no, absolutely not! on the contrary, you'll be considered a well-connected, sociable man, if you keep involved in the conversation all the time. but always pay attention to what you say. if the table has a senior guest, say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible. or maybe, you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested.

person beta:
you mean, keeping a low profile in the presence of the old? that goes in like with confucius'preachings, right?

person alpha:
correct. show respect for the older people. conventionally, before the meal starts, the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one. others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite. toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other.

person beta:
any other rules to observe in order to keep modest?

person alpha:
yes, plenty of them. don't eat fast! people usually keep their dining pace accorded with others. and all the dishes should not be eaten up completely.

person beta:
is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient?

person alpha:
haha, i'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate.

person beta:
our toner cartridges are already out of ink... could you make an order for a new set?

person alpha:
we will need new cartridges for all of the office printers? that will be a large order, probably about two or three cases. the office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock.

person beta:
you can double check with the housekeeping department, but i am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges. last time when we made our order to the supplier, the quantity was also especially high. they are used to receiving such bulk orders from us. as long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance, they can usually fill the order.

person alpha:
ok, i will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure. is there anything else we need to order while i am at it?

person beta:
i think the only thing is toner. try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow. we should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis. anyhow, see what you can do to expedite the order this time.

person alpha:
ok, will do.

person beta:
i want a pair of sports shoes, adidas.

person alpha:
what size do you want?

person beta:
i wear size 40.

person alpha:
how about this one? it's the latest design.

person beta:
oh, i like the color.

person alpha:
may i help you?

person beta:
i'm looking for a pair of shoes.

person alpha:
what size do you wear? these shoes are on sale.

person beta:
i wear size 36.this pair looks nice.can i try them on?

person alpha:
of course, yes.they look nice.and they're not expensive.

person beta:
how much are they?

person alpha:
they are$ 168.

person beta:
i'll take them.

person alpha:
a friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days. he told me the other day he has learned a lot from it. he recommended me to subscribe to it. what do you say?

person beta:
i think it is good if we know enough about career planning. we will make wiser choices. what else did he tell you about it?

person alpha:
well, just something in general, like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals.

person beta:
sounds practical! to be honest, sometimes i feel puzzled about my future career. i am not sure if this job suits me the best though i work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker. i have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills.

person alpha:
making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do. it seems that you need this course more than i do. i love my current job. if i take this course, i hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work. if they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships, that will be great. i need these to improve my current work performance.

person beta:
ok, then we can sign up for it together.

person alpha:
who's it knocking at the door?

person beta:
i think it's the postman.will you go and open the door?

person alpha:
all right. i'll get it.

person beta:
good evening. welcome to cherry's. do you have a reservation?

person alpha:
no, we don't.

person beta:
how many of you, please?

person alpha:
six, including two kids.

person beta:
i'm afraid all the big tables are taken.

person alpha:
hi, i think i was supposed to call for my test results today.

person beta:
if you go onto our website and put in your password, you can access your test results.

person alpha:
are you saying that there weren't any problems?

person beta:
i will always have you come in for a discussion if there is a major problem.

person alpha:
will i be able to read the results on the website and understand them?

person beta:
yes, if you go there, you can see what each test is about.

person alpha:
how will i know what the numbers mean?

person beta:
you can see your results and how they compare to the normal range.

person alpha:
how can i see test results from tests i have taken before?

person beta:
we put all of your test results up in the same place. just check the dates for what you need.

person alpha:
this is our rock-bottom price, mr. lee.

person beta:
if that's the case. there's not much point in further discussion. we might as well call the whole deal off.

person alpha:
what i mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price. the gap is too great.

person beta:
i think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible. how about meeting each other halfway?

person alpha:
what's your proposal?

person beta:
your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we want. well, i suggest we meet each other halfway.

person alpha:
do you mean a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price? that's impossible!

person beta:
what would you suggest?

person alpha:
the best we can do is another 30 dollars off. that's definitely the lowest we can go.

person beta:
that still leaves a gap of 20 dollars. let's meet each other half-away again and split the difference; i think this is a price we can both be satisfied with.

person alpha:
ok. we can meet halfway again.

person beta:
hello.

person alpha:
good morning, ruth. did i wake you up?

person beta:
no, i was just about to get up. what's up, carl?

person alpha:
listen, i am calling to confirm what you said yesterday. are we supposed to meet at the chinatown terminal of the avenue b bus or d bus?

person beta:
b as in boy. you should get off at the last stop in chinatown.

person alpha:
oh, you mean canal street?

person beta:
that's the wrong direction. canal street is on the other side of chinatown.

person alpha:
oh, i get it. when did we decide to meet?

person beta:
at 10,45. is ann coming along?

person alpha:
i cannot get hold of her yet.

person beta:
see you around, carl.

person alpha:
see you later.

person beta:
has your company been affected much by government legislation?

person alpha:
yes, we have. we've had to clean up our production process a lot to meet tough government standards.

person beta:
what about your use of raw materials?

person alpha:
well, we've had to cut down the amount of solvents we use and we're not allowed to use lead in our products any more.

person beta:
what happens if you exceed the limits?

person alpha:
we try not to because you might have to pay quite a heavy fine.

person beta:
have you got any better?

person alpha:
that's the best there is.

person beta:
okay, i'll take one.

person alpha:
that'll be$ 200, sir.

person beta:
good morning, sir. sorry to disturb you. may i make up the room now?

person alpha:
yes, please. we're on our way out, so we put the'make up'sign on. could you bring us some towels and hangers?

person beta:
no problem, sir. everything will be ready when you come back.

person alpha:
what are the factors that have great impact on the perspective of this corporation?

person beta:
external factors. i think the main external factors are political, economic, social and technological factors.

person alpha:
what are the internal factors that influence the company?

person beta:
the internal factors are composed of human resources, team spirit, innovation spirit and coordination between different departments, etc.

person alpha:
i don't want you to be worried, but our son has some bad habits now. he says painful words everyday.

person beta:
what words? can you tell me?

person alpha:
he says kick mommy, beat mommy, don't want mommy, very quickly if i do something that he doesn't like. you know, if i wash his face or change his clothes, things like that.

person beta:
honey, i don't know what to tell you. of course tony is a young child. but do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason.

person alpha:
yes, but sometimes he is just not reasonable.

person beta:
i suggest you treat him with patience, affection, and respect. if he needs to do something, like go to bed, or be washed, etc., please guide or help him to get it done, but lead him with gentleness.

person alpha:
it's easy to say, but i will try.

person beta:
motivate tony to cooperate by rewarding his good behavior. do not emphasize punishment for bad moods, etc. do not threaten him with punishment if he resists the actions you desire.

person alpha:
i know my parents sometimes threaten to punish him. but this doesn't work, instead he picks up another bad habit.

person beta:
how can i help you?

person alpha:
yes, i am james mason from anderson and associates. i would like to see mr. smith.

person beta:
do you have an appointment?

person alpha:
yes, he knows i'm coming. our meeting is set for 2 o'clock.

person beta:
i wonder if mr. smith forgot your meeting. i am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until after 4 pm. let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you in his place. will you please have a seat?

person alpha:
sure.

person beta:
yes, mr. mason, i just checked with our office manager, ms. terry, she said mr. smith briefed her on your project. she is just finishing up a meeting now. she could be with your shortly. would you like me to show you around while you are waiting?

person alpha:
that would be very nice. thank you.

person beta:
right this way, mr. mason. we can start with our front office. when ms. terry is ready, you may take the elevator at the front to the 6th floor. there is a conference room already prepared

person alpha:
did you watch the oscars on sunday night?

person beta:
no, but i heard about that angelina jolie and brad pitt didn't attend.

person alpha:
yes, that was surprising. i heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go.

person beta:
they must be the most famous celebrity couple in hollywood.

person alpha:
they're also one of the richest couples. they have so many money and they can buy almost anything they want.

person beta:
i also heard that tom cruise and katie holmes made an appearance at the oscars.

person alpha:
did either one of them win an oscar this year?

person beta:
i think tom might have been nominated for one of his films, but i don't think he won anything.

person alpha:
tom cruise may be handsome, but i think he's a bit crazy, don't you?

person beta:
yes, his marriage to katie is actually quite scandalous.

person alpha:
i still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves.

person beta:
people in show biz can have such an easy life; i don't know why they have to make it so complicated.

person alpha:
i would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you.

person beta:
that's true. i guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go.

person alpha:
thank goodness we're not rich and famous!

person beta:
being famous, i can do without, but i wouldn't mind being rich.

person alpha:
next, please.

person beta:
could i purchase euro with rib here? i have to stay here for months.

person alpha:
yes, the rate for cash purchases is listed on the electronica screen, so you have seen the rate of exchange.

person beta:
yes, i have known of it.

person alpha:
how much do you like to exchange?

person beta:
20,000 rib.

person alpha:
in what denominations?

person beta:
it doesn't matter, but leave me some small changes, that will be convenient in daily life.

person alpha:
right, i will exchange for you now. please sign the exchange form giving the name and telephone.

person beta:
well, could you change them too? the dollars, i want to change them into swiss francs.

person alpha:
ok, wait for a moment. well, i am sorry, but we are not authorized to exchange coins because it is low and we do not have enough foreign coins. in this case, you'd better change 2,000$ to swiss francs.

person beta:
it doesn't matter.

person alpha:
please sign the memo on the bottom and keep your money and memo.

person beta:
thanks a lot. good-bye.

person alpha:
why are you holding me in this jail cell?

person beta:
we'd like to hear your account of the events of last night.

person alpha:
i have to go up to london for a couple of days next week. would you like to come?

person beta:
that would be nice. how are you getting there?

person alpha:
well, i prefer to go on the train, but i suppose you want me to take the car.

person beta:
oh, i much prefer to go by car, then we don't need to get to the station with our luggage and...

person alpha:
and i've got to drive. you know i'm not fond of that. i found it much more relaxing to sit in the train.

person beta:
which is more expensive?

person alpha:
but very much quicker. but i know we'll never agree on this subject. you prefer the car. i prefer the train.

person beta:
now, have you ever thought of going by express bus?

person alpha:
i want to take a look at that home with the open house flags out front.

person beta:
what a wonderful neighborhood! can you find that house on our open house list?

person alpha:
yes, that is one of the houses that we have on our list.

person beta:
they always make the front yards look so great for open houses. let's see what the inside looks like.

person alpha:
i am going to go sign my name in the registry to let the listing agent know that we were here.

person beta:
signing the registry is a good idea. i think i want to see the kitchen next.

person alpha:
i really appreciate that the listing agent provided water on such a hot day.

person beta:
i need to pick up a flyer with the information about the house on it.

person alpha:
is the current asking price listed on the flyer?

person beta:
the asking price has recently gone down to two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars.

person alpha:
hello. this is mrs. wilson. i'd like to buy a new car. could you offer me a new type of the car, please?

person beta:
oh, madam, buy what?

person alpha:
a new car. and i've got a small family, two children, and i haven't got a lot of money and...

person beta:
oh, oh, madam, madam, i'm afraid you have the wrong number.

person alpha:
isn't this the car store?

person beta:
no. it's mike's sporting goods.

person alpha:
oh, sorry. do you know the number for a car store, then?

person beta:
no. i don't. i suggest you look in the phone book.

person alpha:
i'm sorry to have bothered you.

person beta:
no problem.

person alpha:
how about going to the cinema tonight?

person beta:
that's great. what's on tonight?

person alpha:
i am not sure about the name of the film, but i know it's a romantic one.

person beta:
romantic? i am afraid i like thrillers better.

person alpha:
don't you think it's too bloody?

person beta:
on the contrary, very exciting.

person alpha:
hello, i scheduled an appointment with dr. smith, and i can't make it on that day.

person beta:
what day was your appointment on?

person alpha:
my appointment was on monday.

person beta:
what time had you chosen?

person alpha:
it was for 10

person beta:
i am looking at your appointment right now. what day would you prefer?

person alpha:
i would prefer next thursday.

person beta:
what time would be best for you?

person alpha:
i want to come in at 2

person beta:
i am writing you down for that time. we look forward to seeing you.

person alpha:
office supplies, inc. robert speaking, may i help you?

person beta:
hi, robert. this is janet reese calling from american advertising. we placed an order with you about a week ago.

person alpha:
yes, ms. reese. i remember, you spoke with me. is there a problem?

person beta:
well, it still hasn't gotten here, and my boss is pretty angry about it.

person alpha:
ms anderson, my name is mike. i am division chief of abc company. welcome to toronto.

person beta:
thank you. it's a pleasure to meet you.

person alpha:
a pleasure meeting you as well, the flowers are for you.

person beta:
thank you, they are beautiful.

person alpha:
i am really interested in buying this television.

person beta:
that's so great!

person alpha:
how much are you selling it for?

person beta:
this t. v is only$ 2500.

person alpha:
you can't be serious.

person beta:
that's how much this t. v costs.

person alpha:
that's too expensive for me.

person beta:
this television is of very high quality.

person alpha:
you can't go down on the price.

person beta:
by how much?

person alpha:
i'll buy it for$ 2000.

person beta:
i'm sorry, but the price is final.

person alpha:
did you pack this bag yourself? has it been out of your possession at any time before checking-in?

person beta:
yes, i packed it myself, and it hasn't been out of my possession.

person alpha:
are you bringing in any plants or animal products?

person beta:
no.

person alpha:
our sniffer dog seems to disagree. do you mind if we look in your suitcase?

person beta:
not at all. go right ahead.

person alpha:
what's this sir?

person beta:
it's traditional chinese medicine. i mix it with hot water like tea. sorry. i forgot about it.

person alpha:
what are these red things sir?

person beta:
oh no! i forgot about those too! those are chinese sausages for my aunt lily.

person alpha:
i'm sorry sir, but you can't take any of this into the country. we will also have to check your carry-on. please step this way. don't'be nervous; we'll just look through it briefly and then

person beta:
hello.is bob there, please?

person alpha:
hold on a second please. i'm sorry. he has gone out.

person beta:
oh.this is paul.when will he be back?

person alpha:
he will be back at about seven o'clock.

person beta:
can i leave a message please?

person alpha:
yes, certainly.

person beta:
please tell him i'll call him at the office tomorrow afternoon.

person alpha:
all right. i'll tell him when he comes back.

person beta:
thank you very much.

person alpha:
hey, son, are you insured?

person beta:
not yet, but i'm thinking of it. have you bought one, dad?

person alpha:
i took out a life insurance policy and made your mother the beneficiary.

person beta:
can you tell me why you want to buy it?

person alpha:
i am a fireman and it is a dangerous job. i have to consider your mother's life.

person beta:
oh, i see. do you advise me to buy one?

person alpha:
you have children now. what if something, god forbid, happens to you?

person beta:
that's true. well, how much do you think i should get?

person alpha:
a$ 100 000 policy shouldn't be too expensive. here, call my agent. he'll give you a good deal.

person beta:
excuse me, mr. emory? mr. macmillan, would like to know if you have the completed schedule for next week?

person alpha:
yes, i do, susan. just a moment. here it is.

person beta:
thank you, sir. sorry to trouble you.

person alpha:
not at all, susan. just tell him to leave it with my secretary when he's finished with it

person beta:
where are you going, jane?

person alpha:
i'm going to the hospital to see susan.

person beta:
i saw her yesterday.she was a little better.

person alpha:
must i catch a number 7 bus to get there?

person beta:
no, you needn't. a number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital.

person alpha:
number 13 buses run much more frequently, don't they?

person beta:
yes. i caught a number 7 bus yesterday, and they said i had taken a wrong bus.

person alpha:
thank you, henry. i'll get a number 13.

person beta:
but number 13 buses leave from the center of town.you'll have to walk two miles to catch one.

person alpha:
good morning, passport, please.

person beta:
here you are.

person alpha:
ah, thank you.please bring your luggage here for inspection.

person beta:
ok.but is there anything wrong?

person alpha:
it's just a regular inspection. do you have anything to declare?

person beta:
i've got 6 packets of cigarettes and 2 bottles of champagne.besides, i have two cameras, one is for my own use, and the other is a gift.

person alpha:
well, the cigarettes and the champagne are not in excess of the duty-free allowance. but according to our law, each passenger is allowed only one camera duty-free.you'll have to pay duty for the other one.

person beta:
ok. where shall i pay duty for it?

person alpha:
please wait a minute. i'll make out the duty memo... here you are.take this and pay to the woman over there.

person beta:
i've paid for it. here's the receipt.

person alpha:
very well. i hope you'll enjoy your stay in america.

person beta:
thank you.

person alpha:
hello, nancy, nice to see you.

person beta:
nice to see you, too. i heard you are a staff of nokia company.

person alpha:
yes, i'm satisfied with this job.

person beta:
congratulations. what did you do during the interview?

person alpha:
pay more attention to the external expressions, because they are important for the first impression. good manner and style of conversation can let other feel your good self-cultivation. good gestures and mien can let other feel very comfortable.

person beta:
how can i have the good external expressions?

person alpha:
don't worry about that. you just pay more attention to the details of people's action in life, and you will know how to transfer information by their body language.

person beta:
stupid girl, making me spend so much money, now i have to get it from the atm...

person alpha:
hello, welcome to universal bank. please insert your card into the slot.

person beta:
i know where to put my card! stupid machine, talking to me like i'm an idiot...

person alpha:
please input your 6 digit pin code followed by the pound key. thank you. please select an option.thank you. you have selected withdrawal.

person beta:
yeah, yeah, i know what i selected. just gimme my money!

person alpha:
please type the amount you would like to withdraw. thank you, you want to transfer 10000 usd to the world wildlife foundation. if this is correct please press 1.

person beta:
no, no! stupid machine, what are you doing! no!

person alpha:
confirmed. thank you for using our bank! please remove your card from the slot. goodbye!

person beta:
no, no way! what happened? give me my money!

person alpha:
danger, danger! the exits have been sealed and the doors will remain locked in until the local authorities arrive. thank you for using our bank. have a nice day.

person beta:
joe, how are you doing?

person alpha:
i am great! how about you, mary? how are you?

person beta:
i am doing great! thank you for asking, joe.

person alpha:
i was wondering if you want to go see a movie with me tonight?

person beta:
i need to stay home tonight and finish my term paper.

person alpha:
ok. what about going to the movies on friday night?

person beta:
what were you planning on seeing?

person alpha:
i was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer.

person beta:
how about" the secret life of bees"?

person alpha:
that's a chick flick!

person beta:
what do you think we need to do to get our new branch office running well?

person alpha:
first, i'd make sure that we have a good, local, corporate lawyer. he or she will know all the local laws and regulations.

person beta:
that's very important. a friend recommended a good law firm to me. we'll need someone to hire staff.

person alpha:
i think that we should send one of our hr people to do that. i don't think we should use an agency, because they won't be familiar with the type of people we employ. have we decide on the location of

person beta:
yes. we have. we chose the location in the northeast of the city, not too far from the airport and on the edge of the cbd.

person alpha:
why didn't we choose an office in the cbd?

person beta:
the offices there were too expensive. have we negotiated any contracts yet?

person alpha:
yes. we've signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries. we hope to sign another three this month.

person beta:
when will the branch office open?

person alpha:
hopefully next month. everything is a little rushed. we should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly.

person beta:
has and advertising campaign been prepared?

person alpha:
yes, it has. we're going to target the business community through business magazines.

person beta:
i made plenty of business contract on my last visit and through the embassy. we should be able to get plenty of customers.

person alpha:
good afternoon. what can i do for you?

person beta:
i want to pick up my valuables.

person alpha:
may i have your key please?

person beta:
sure. here you are.

person alpha:
here is your valuable. is that right?

person beta:
yes, thank you.

person alpha:
did you know that abortion is still illegal in many states in the usa?

person beta:
why? i thought americans were supposed to be more open than that.

person alpha:
well, for many religious people, they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers.

person beta:
do you think most people in america believe that abortion is wrong?

person alpha:
no, i think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions.

person beta:
it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in america.

person alpha:
religious people blame it on pre-marital sex, not on abortion being illegal.

person beta:
what do you think about abortion?

person alpha:
i personally would never want to have one, but i think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life, she should have the right to decide for herself.

person beta:
do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter?

person alpha:
i know this is going to sound sexist, but i don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children.

person beta:
why not? it's their children, too.

person alpha:
that may be true, but when a woman gets pregnant, it changes her life completely. men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand.

person beta:
that might be true, but i think men should have some kind of say in the matter.

person alpha:
come to think of it, you should get out your english books and catch up on your reading assignments.

person beta:
but i don't have any reading assignments.

person alpha:
then review for your test. you'll do even better. and maybe reading will help you get to sleep.

person beta:
aw, mom-you're such a drag.

person alpha:
you say that now, lily, but you'll thank me later. i'm your mom, and mother knows best.

person beta:
i'm just calling to see if you have made any decision about the position.

person alpha:
sorry, we haven't made the decision at all.

person beta:
do you have any idea when you might arrive at a decision?

person alpha:
we will let you know probably next monday. i hope to give you a positive reply.

person beta:
i'm willing to wait until you have come to a decision.

person alpha:
how did you find your apartment?

person beta:
you can check on the bulletin boards at school for local housing.

person alpha:
what if i need a roommate?

person beta:
there are websites that can hook you up with a roommate.

person alpha:
how much do apartments cost around here?

person beta:
it depends on what you want. do you want a one- or two-bedroom apartment?

person alpha:
i just need a one-bedroom apartment.

person beta:
that will probably cost you around twelve hundred dollars a month.

person alpha:
would you come with me to look at apartments?

person beta:
i would be happy to look at apartments with you.

person alpha:
have you heard what happened?

person beta:
heard what?

person alpha:
deborah already had her baby.

person beta:
i didn't know that.

person alpha:
i thought you knew.

person beta:
i honestly didn't know.

person alpha:
the baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces.

person beta:
that's good to hear.

person alpha:
will you go and visit them?

person beta:
of course i will.

person alpha:
i just wanted to give you the good news.

person beta:
thanks for letting me know.

person alpha:
how silly of you to jump out of the window!

person beta:
but that was the first thing that came into my mind when i heard the shout earthquake!

person alpha:
why not use staircases? the terror was not so violent at that time.

person beta:
that would be too late.

person alpha:
maybe the situation is too urgent.

person beta:
yes, i think i should have jumped in any case.

person alpha:
i need to stop eating such unhealthy foods.

person beta:
i know what you mean. i've started eating better myself.

person alpha:
what foods do you eat now?

person beta:
i tend to stick to fruits, vegetables, and chicken.

person alpha:
those are the only things you eat?

person beta:
that's basically what i eat.

person alpha:
why aren't you eating anything else?

person beta:
well, fruits and vegetables are very healthy.

person alpha:
and the chicken?

person beta:
it's really healthy to eat when you bake it.

person alpha:
i guess that does sound a lot healthier.

person beta:
good morning! i am a new comer in our office.

person alpha:
good morning! welcome to our office!

person beta:
nice to meet you! my name is grace williams.

person alpha:
nice to meet you too! i am peter smith.

person beta:
today is my first day at work!

person alpha:
well, hope you will enjoy your first day! just ask me if you need any help.

person beta:
thank you. it's very kind of you.

person alpha:
you are welcome.

person beta:
do you have experience in advertising?

person alpha:
yes, i used to have a part-time job in advertising company.

person beta:
what were you mean duties there?

person alpha:
i mostly did advertising planning.

person beta:
what qualities do you think an advertising planner should have?

person alpha:
i think an advertising planner should have active thoughts, creative talent, and be sensitive to the changes in the market.

person beta:
what was the most important thing you have learned at work?

person alpha:
the most important thing i learned was that i must continuously improve my abilities. advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact to success. if i want to make in marking in advertising industry, i can't stop studying and creating.

person beta:
the air conditioning is not working! we need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here!

person alpha:
dan is on top of that. i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up.

person beta:
that would be convenient. they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring. the circuit breakers keep going out all the time. it's really annoying!

person alpha:
yeah you are right. this office is falling apart! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that's why the parking lot was flooded.

person beta:
i know! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him.

person alpha:
do you have anything to do after this?

person beta:
no, i don't.

person alpha:
shall we drop in somewhere for a couple of drinks?

person beta:
that sounds like a good idea.

person alpha:
i know a very interesting place.

person beta:
oh, do you? good.

person alpha:
oh, hi, jessica, are you going to see this movie too?

person beta:
i'd love to, the movies are smash hit.

person alpha:
then let's go in.

person beta:
i can't. i'm waiting for paul, but he's late.

person alpha:
i'll say the movie's starting in the minute.

person beta:
i know. i wonder what's keeping him.

person alpha:
looks like he won't show up. he's done this before, hasn't he?

person beta:
yeah, a number of times.

person alpha:
what's he trying to pull anyway.

person beta:
i don't know. but this is definitely the last straw.

person alpha:
maybe you should start seeing someone else.

person beta:
you said it. ok, let's go in, sandy.

person alpha:
i can't believe how hot it is.

person beta:
it's not even noon yet.

person alpha:
that means it will get hotter.

person beta:
i am dying from the heat.

person alpha:
turn on the air conditioner.

person beta:
it doesn't work.

person alpha:
what happened?

person beta:
i don't know.

person alpha:
did you call the repairman?

person beta:
of course.

person alpha:
when is he coming?

person beta:
he's busy. he said next week.

person alpha:
please help yourself to whatever you like, don't be shy.

person beta:
yes, thank you. i've already been helping myself.

person alpha:
this dish taste terrific. would you like to try a little? it is a little hot, but very good.

person beta:
i like hot food, especially sichuan cuisine.

person alpha:
would you like another beer?

person beta:

person beta:
when was america discovered, tony?

person alpha:
i'm not certain. do you know?

person beta:
america was discovered by christopher columbus in 1492.

person alpha:
in a way that's right. but the vikings travelled there long beforecolumbus. and what about the red indians?

person beta:
all right. ask me a question now.

person alpha:
who invented the electric light bulb?

person beta:
that's easy. it was invented by edison.

person alpha:
correct. now for a harder question. who will be the first men on mars?

person beta:
i can't answer that. but i think mars will be visited by men before theed of this century.

person alpha:
ask me a question now.

person beta:
all right. what is the nearest planet to the sun?

person alpha:
that's easy. it's.. er. venus. no. pluto. no. wait a minute. it's anthe tip of my tongue. oh dear, what is the nearest planet to the sun?

person beta:
check out these wheels!

person alpha:
you bought a compact car?

person beta:
no, i borrowed it.

person alpha:
let me guess, from sarah. it looks like something she would drive.

person beta:
you guessed right. besides, the color violet is a little girly for me.

person alpha:
i love it. it's so festive! and where did you get that cup? it's got the same logo.

person beta:
we quarreled yesterday, and he picked up and left.

person alpha:
terrible! does he want to divorce?

person beta:
i am not sure.

person alpha:
don't lose your reason. go to find him and talk with him.

person beta:
whew! i had to wait for almost an hour to get to the front of the line.

person alpha:
you have much patience.

person beta:
wow! your calligraphy is very beautiful. it was worth the wait!

person alpha:
thank you. today i'm writing a kind of poem called a chinese couplet.

person beta:
what does it say?

person alpha:
this is an especially famous one. it says" may the passing days bring you health and longevity. may this season of renewal find you basked in riches."

person beta:
that's very nice. is it for sale?

person alpha:
no. i never sell my artwork.

person beta:
really? then what do you do with it?

person alpha:
i give it away. here, this one is for you.

person beta:
wow! really? are you sure? now i'll have a lucky year!

person alpha:
remember, real luck must be created( by) yourself, and then it cannot be given or taken away...

person beta:
i often recalled the days when tom and i were madly in love.

person alpha:
very romantic?

person beta:
yeah. he always tickled my finny bone with his college stories.

person alpha:
you married him for that reason?

person beta:
definitely not. the most important thing was we loved each other.

person alpha:
it seldom rains this summer.

person beta:
yeah, some places are very short of water.

person alpha:
because of pollution and other things, our environment has become worse and worse.

person beta:
you see, this time i traveled to the west. when i looked out of the windows of the rain, all the lands that i could see are as dry as a bone.

person alpha:
it is serious.

person beta:
i'm looking forward to summer vacation.

person alpha:
me too.

person beta:
my granny is such a kind-hearted person. she is willing to help.

person alpha:
she does have a heart of gold.

person beta:
you can say that again.

person alpha:
look at this newspaper article about this famous local medium. it says that she is really gifted and so popular now, that she is booked solid with appointments for the next twelve months!

person beta:
you don't really believe in all that hocus pocus mumbo jumbo, do you?

person alpha:
well, i have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their palms read and most of the things the psychic told her came true!

person beta:
of course it does! they tell you general and obvious things like that you will be successful or have a big house. i think most of the times they are just scam artists.

person alpha:
well, historically it is a practice that many cultures share. reading the tarot cards, in the east they would even read tea leaves! i even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar, and then read your ashes.

person beta:
all superstitious nonsense! i would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say, just for kicks.

person alpha:
can i help you, sir?

person beta:
yes, i'd like a book about law.

person alpha:
would you tell me the name of the book and the author?

person beta:
uh, the origin of law. and it's written by professor felix of harvard.

person alpha:
i'm sorry. it's out of stock now. could you come by again next week?

person beta:
next week? it is too late. i need it urgently.

person alpha:
well, then, is it convenient to leave your phone number so that i can inform you as soon as we restock it?

person beta:
no, thanks any way.

person alpha:
you're welcome.

person beta:
bob!

person alpha:
anne! i haven't seen you for ages.how've you been?

person beta:
fine, just fine.and you?

person alpha:
not bad.it really is great to see you again.where have you been?

person beta:
guangzhou. i've got a cousin there.

person alpha:
i am so glad i caught you at home. i need your help!

person beta:
what's up, robert?

person alpha:
cafe au lait, cafe latte, cappuccino, cafe mocha... i can't keep them all straight!

person beta:
slow down. what are you talking about?

person alpha:
it's about a girl. no, an angel! i'm going to the coffee shop where she works right now.

person beta:
hello, is this the abc company?

person alpha:
yes, may i help you?

person beta:
we have just arrived from tokyo only... looking for a reserve car of your company. all of above, we cannot find it.

person alpha:
what is your reservation number?

person beta:
our reservation number is j- 221.

person alpha:
let me see. oh, yes, we have your reservation number.

person beta:
you mean you haven't arranged any car?

person alpha:
i'm sorry to say no.

person beta:
here i'll take taxi instead, how do you refund us?

person alpha:
what kind of gas does this car take?

person beta:
i don't know. it's a rental.

person alpha:
i will give you premium unleaded. alright?

person beta:
sure, why not?

person alpha:
that is the pump you are in front of.

person beta:
is it expensive?

person alpha:
it is the most expensive.

person beta:
well, i don't want it then. can i move to another pump?

person alpha:
yes, i can give you regular unleaded. but you have to back up the car a little.

person beta:
give me regular unleaded then. i will back up.can you wash my windows for me?

person alpha:
i'm sorry, sir. this is not a full service gas station. i will help you fill the gas, but we don't wash windows here.

person beta:
really? well, i guess i have to get used to it.

person alpha:
mary, it's good to see you!

person beta:
josh and i were just on our way back home from the beach and thought we'd drop by.

person alpha:
i am so glad that you decided to stop by!

person beta:
yes, it has been a long time since we have seen you.

person alpha:
mary, can i get josh or you something to drink?

person beta:
oh no, thank you. we aren't all that thirsty.

person alpha:
how about a little snack then?

person beta:
no, thank you, we just ate lunch a little while ago.

person alpha:
well then, how is your family?

person beta:
everyone is doing great. my sister finally had her baby.

person alpha:
everything is now. i'm kind of sick of it.

person beta:
each ring has 3 small diamonds inside the band.

person alpha:
oooh! one for each of the zeros in 2000! wow!

person beta:
stop making fun of me.

person alpha:
so find a guy to marry and you can get one!

person beta:
i don't need a guy to buy a wedding ring!

person alpha:
oh, i see. you're going to wear one and pretend you're married to try to attract guys.

person beta:
i went to the tutoring service centre on campus today. and i got a job.

person alpha:
congratulation. what will you do?

person beta:
they got me a part-time tutoring job, teaching an australian businessman chinese.

person alpha:
that's wonderful. i want to get a part-time job too. tell me what i should do.

person beta:
it's very simple actually. you can go to the service centre and have your name and job interest resisted. they will give you a call if any job comes up.

person alpha:
good. i'll do it.

person beta:
has robert ever missed coming to one of our parties?

person alpha:
only once or twice at the most.

person beta:
do you know why?

person alpha:
i have no idea.

person beta:
wow! what a beautiful scenic spot! it's so open. and just breathe that fresh air, you can almost taste its freshness.

person alpha:
you can have a bird view of guiling city from the top of the mountain.

person beta:
wonderful! i'll often come here for mountain climbing.

person alpha:
you should. many guiliners, especially the old and the young, will climb mountains here in the morning.

person beta:
no wonder people say

person alpha:
quick! pass me your binoculars. look at that bird... i've never seen one of those before. it's indigenous to guiling, and an endangered species too. this is lucky!

person beta:
i didn't know you liked bird-watching.

person alpha:
i don't really. i just like wildlife, and you don't get to see too much of it in the city. this place is full of it.

person beta:
hide me, yi-jun! the kids all think i'm the real easter bunny!

person alpha:
aw, that's sweet! i knew your costume would be a success.

person beta:
it's a success all right. the kids keep trying to catch me.

person alpha:
yeah, i saw that. i thought you were playing a game with them.

person beta:
some game! you try being tackled by ten kids at once!

person alpha:
um, holly? look behind you. they're coming this way.

person beta:
hi, bob, i am so glad that you came.

person alpha:
of course i'd come. i couldn't think of a better chance to see all my old friends.

person beta:
yeah. it's hard to believe that it's been ten years since graduation. it feels just yesterday we collected our diplomas.

person alpha:
how time flies. but hey, how are things going with you?

person beta:
oh, where to start? there have been ups and downs. i'm still trying to find my place in this world. it's only recently that i've been able to start settling down. how about you? you still with jenn

person alpha:
yeah, jenny and i got married right after graduation. it was tough the first years trying to make ends meet. i was supporting us both while she continued her studies. but now things are getting better

person beta:
oh, that sounds wonderful. i have always known you two would make it. i hope i can keep in better contact with you guys. i don't want us to drift apart again.

person alpha:
definitely! actually, we just moved into a new place. there's a house-warming party this saturday, if you are free? i know jenny would love to see you again and it should be a good party.

person beta:
sounds great! i'll be there.

person alpha:
i guess i'm just a little nervous. i'm giving everything i have to invoking, and...

person beta:
and what if it doesn't work out, right?

person alpha:
exactly.

person beta:
you need to quit thinking like a loser. invoking is going to kick butt. you know how i know?

person alpha:
how?

person beta:
because i won't let it fail.

person alpha:
but what about tomorrow? what if stars.com decides to go with webtracker, and not us?

person beta:
are you ready for the camping trip?

person alpha:
all set. i've got my makeup, my cds, and my portable tv set...

person beta:
hello! we're supposed to be getting back to nature.

person alpha:
yeah, yeah. anyway... i'm packed. are you?

person beta:
i've been packed for a week. all my stuff is in this backpack.

person alpha:
let me see... two books... birdseed?

person beta:
that's trail mix!

person alpha:
same difference. what's this?

person beta:
it's getting late. i really have to go.

person alpha:
i hope we'll get together again soon.

person beta:
i hope so. a good journey to you!

person alpha:
thank you.

person beta:
i'm fed up with marriage.

person alpha:
why do you say so? everyone admires that you have a good wife.

person beta:
oh, no. when we were poor, we often tried our best to make ends meet. it was a hard time.

person alpha:
but now you are rich.

person beta:
and we have some squabbles on some boring things.

person alpha:
this is ordinary marriage life.

person beta:
how about you and tom? what time is your wedding?

person alpha:
don't be kidding, ok?

person beta:
what's the matter? so angry. i'm just playing a joke with you.

person alpha:
because i have given him up as a bad job. our relation has been over.

person beta:
margaret, do you think i should enroll in the science course?

person alpha:
yes, i think so, if you want to graduated this year, you've got to take a science course.

person beta:
right, i figure since you are doing premedical, you know about the very courses.

person alpha:
well, i have to take biology, chemistry, maps and physics.what you need is a good introductory course for non-science majors.

person beta:
yes, i really weak in maps, i did poorly in high school.

person alpha:
that's a problem.

person beta:
what are you listening to? is that beethoven or mozart?

person alpha:
it's beethoven. do you like it?

person beta:
i think beethoven's music is incredible. i've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent, too. do you believe that?

person alpha:
i don't know about that, but i do think that it helps people relax.

person beta:
what other kind of music do you listen to?

person alpha:
actually, i mostly just listen classical music. what about you?

person beta:
to be honest, i think classical music is too complicated for me.

person alpha:
what kind of music do you prefer then?

person beta:
i like pop music. do you?

person alpha:
not really. i don't think pop music has much depth.

person beta:
i see what you mean. i think that's way i like it so much.

person alpha:
how long have you been in to pop music, then?

person beta:
i've always been into it. have you always liked classical music?

person alpha:
not really. when i was little, we didn't really listen to music at all.

person beta:
so, how did you become interested in it?

person alpha:
well, when i was about 10 years old, i started playing the piano. i think that's how it all started.

person beta:
do you still play piano?

person alpha:
yes, it's one of my hobbies.

person beta:
hi paul. how are you, friend.

person alpha:
not good. my cousin is driving me up the wall.

person beta:
how so?

person alpha:
he stays up untill all hours of the night, and he never lifts a finger to help.

person beta:
have you talk to him about it?

person alpha:
not yet, but i have to soon. he's eating me out of house and home. i caught him reading the fridge again last night

person beta:
ahahah, maybe that will help you lose weight.

person alpha:
this is no laughing matter, nick.

person beta:
sorry paul. i couldn't help it. so why doesn't he give you a hand?

person alpha:
he watch the tob too much. now really i don't know. but i can't handle this much longer.

person beta:
well, talk to him, and let me know what happens, ok?

person alpha:
you're from new york, aren't you?

person beta:
yes, that's right.

person alpha:
what do you suggest i should see in new york?

person beta:
well, how about the museum of modern art?

person alpha:
no, i don't like museums. they're boring.

person beta:
why don't you go to see the empire state building?

person alpha:
ah! that sounds interesting.

person beta:
what's your favorite book?

person alpha:
it's gone with the wind.

person beta:
why do you like it best?

person alpha:
i enjoy the various characters and the plot.

person beta:
well. i like the thom birds best.

person alpha:
is it very interesting?

person beta:
sure. i like the writer's language, too.

person alpha:
if i have a chance, i'll enjoy the book.

person beta:
would you like to go to the bookshop with me?

person alpha:
that's a good idea. let's go!

person beta:
john, my father isn't there at all. are you kidding?

person alpha:
cool, fellow, what's the date today, buddy?

person beta:
it's... oh it's the 1st april, april fool's day.

person alpha:
you forgot all of about it, didn't you?

person beta:
i'm pretty sure that jim will turn out to be a good lawyer.

person alpha:
how can you be so sure?

person beta:
he knows a lot about law and he's eloquent, too.

person alpha:
could you tell me if you have ever taken a class from dr. miller?

person beta:
yes. are you going to be taking a class from him?

person alpha:
yes, but i have never taken his class before.

person beta:
he is very interesting and challenging. is that what you are looking for?

person alpha:
yes, that's what i need.

person beta:
he is really clear on what you need to learn to get a good grade. are you willing to study hard?

person alpha:
yes, i guess so.

person beta:
what i really liked about him is that he was an understanding and friendly teacher. do you enjoy that in a teacher?

person alpha:
yes, i had a teacher like that before.

person beta:
did you know that he has 20 years teaching experience?

person alpha:
no, i didn't, but that could be a good thing.

person beta:
well, take a look at everything and figure out what is best for you. good luck!

person alpha:
honey, what's wrong with you?

person beta:
i'm not feeling well. i'm very nervous.

person alpha:
take it easy. we are going to have our own baby. you should be happy.

person beta:
yeah, i know.

person alpha:
the doctors and the nurses will help you. and i will be waiting for you right here, praying for you and our baby.

person beta:
thank you, dear. i feel better now.

person alpha:
the weather is terrible.

person beta:
yeah. it's been raining a lot these days.

person alpha:
i have been watching a lot of videos at home because of the constant rain.

person beta:
have you heard when it's supposed to get better?

person alpha:
i saw the weather report, and it's going to rain for the next eight days.

person beta:
that sucks so much. what are we going to do?

person alpha:
i'm getting pretty bored. we should do something despite the rain.

person beta:
i'm with you. what do you have in mind?

person alpha:
i haven't been to the mall in a long time. let's go there.

person beta:
that sounds good. they have a movie theatre there, so if we get bored, we can watch a movie.

person alpha:
great. i'll stop by your place now.

person beta:
ok. don't forget to bring your umbrella. the rain can start up again anytime.

person alpha:
come in, come in, what can i do for you?

person beta:
professor donald, are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester?

person alpha:
yes, i am applying on it.

person beta:
i wonder if i could enroll in it. i know it is a graduate course and i'm a junior, but...

person alpha:
aren't you a bit young? i have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up.

person beta:
i know, but geology of the american west is my major interest and i have done a large reading in the field.

person alpha:
well, if you think you are ready, i'll let you enroll.

person beta:
oh, thanks, professor donald. this is really very nice of you.

person alpha:
... so, i said, let's take a break.and since that night, i've been waiting for him to call, but i still haven't heard from him. you don't think he's seeing someone else, do you?

person beta:
come on, don't be so dramatic! i'm sure everything is going to work out just fine.

person alpha:
you think so? oh, no! how can he do this to me? i'm sure he's cheating on me! why else wouldn't he call?

person beta:
but, you two are on a break. theoretically he can do whatever he likes.

person alpha:
he's the love of my life! i've really messed this up.

person beta:
come on, hon. pull yourself together. it's going to be alright.

person alpha:
but i... i still love him! and it's all my fault! i can't believe how immature and selfish i was being. i mean, he is a firefighter, it's not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner. i've totally messed this up!

person beta:
you know what, veronica, i think you should make the first step. i'm sure he'll forgive you...

person alpha:
no, this is not gonna happen! i... i've ruined everything...

person beta:
do you hear something?

person alpha:
what's wrong, jerry? you look so upset.

person beta:
to be honest, i was just dumped.

person alpha:
oh, i'm sorry to hear that. you can go on a holiday to cheer you up.

person beta:
no, thanks. i'm not in the mood for traveling.

person alpha:
come on. a trip will do you good. are you doing anything this weekend?

person beta:
i was planning on doing a lot of wallowing.

person alpha:
well, my friends and i are planning on going to shangri-la on saturday. do you want to come with us?

person beta:
where is that?

person alpha:
not very far from here. we'll fly. it's about one and a half hours.

person beta:
what's there to see?

person alpha:
there is a large canyon, vast grasslands, ancient forests and mountain lakes.

person beta:
oh, sounds nice.

person alpha:
yes, the scenery there is breathtaking. i have some pictures at home. you can come over and take a look if you like.

person beta:
ok. then i can make up my mind.

person alpha:
did you have any kind of punishment in your life and studies?

person beta:
yes, just once.

person alpha:
what was the reason?

person beta:
i once played truant when i was in college because i intended to organize a donation activity for the disaster-hit areas in sichuan.

person alpha:
do you want to hang out tomorrow?

person beta:
oh, i can't. i have a date!

person alpha:
really? wow with who?

person beta:
this girl i've been chatting with for the past couple of months. she's really cool and she's driving over here this weekend.

person alpha:
wait a minute, you mean you met her online?

person beta:
yeah! i signed up for a website called match@. com and it is great! you fill in all your details and preferences, like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets. then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat.

person alpha:
that is kind of weird! what if she is a psycho or something like that?

person beta:
it's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them! i am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends! i think this is a really cool alternative, especially if you are a bit shy.

person alpha:
i guess it does seem logical. i'll have to check it out!

person beta:
well, i'm afraid i must be going now. i have no idea it was so late.

person alpha:
stay for dinner with us.

person beta:
i'm afraid i can't. i have a dinner party at seven tonight. you see, i am going to england the day after tomorrow.

person alpha:
well, i won't keep you then. it was very nice of you to come to see me.

person beta:
it has been a pleasure. goodbye.

person alpha:
goodbye. thank you again for coming.

person beta:
honey, do you have a second?

person alpha:
sure! are you okay? you seem a bit worried.what's on your mind?

person beta:
we need to talk.

person alpha:
okay...

person beta:
i've been thinking, and well, i think we need to start seeing other people.

person alpha:
what? why? i mean, we've had our ups and downs, and we have the occasional disagreement, but we're happy together, aren't we?

person beta:
that's just it, i'm not happy anymore, tim. it's not you, it's me. i know that i can be hard to deal with, and you are a great guy! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for!

person alpha:
so, what are you saying? you're breaking up with me because i'm perfect?

person beta:
tim, you are too good for me. you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy. oh, i could say that i'll be all you need, but that would be a lie. i know i'd only hurt you, i know i'd only make you cry.

person alpha:
baby, come on. don't do this to me! whatever it is, we can work it out. just give me another chance! i know that we can get through this, but we gotta stick together! don't leave me.

person beta:
i can't, tim. i hope someday you can find some way to understand i'm only doing this for you. i don't really wanna go but, deep in my heart i know this is the kindest thing to do.

person alpha:
laura...

person beta:
here are your keys. i'll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week. i'm sorry, tim. i wish you all the best, and i hope that one day we can meet again. i'll always love you. goodbye.

person alpha:
oh, my god. i can't take it any more.

person beta:
what's wrong, honey? take it easy.

person alpha:
i am tired of doing that boring work. i just repeat doing counting everyday. it's so terrible.

person beta:
me too. but i think we can do something else for a change.

person alpha:
you know i work with my professional knowledge not passion. sometimes i don't know what the meaning of working is?

person beta:
but you did a good job. you always perform the best in our company.

person alpha:
yes, that's in the past. maybe i need to go to my psychologist for help.

person beta:
perhaps you've just tired and you need a vacation.

person alpha:
i was full of ambitions before. but now i have no aim for my career.

person beta:
maybe we should keep on studying to enrich our knowledge and make our life exciting.

person alpha:
that sounds interesting. but i don't know how to do that.

person beta:
how about a training course?

person alpha:
a training course? that must be costly.

person beta:
but it's worth it. maybe it can get us into a good mood and also helps us learn something to use for the future.

person alpha:
ok, let's have a try.

person beta:
ok.

person alpha:
have you seen the new james bond movie?

person beta:
oh, yes. you?

person alpha:
yes. what did you think of it?

person beta:
i thought it was better than the others-i really liked it. what did you think of it?

person alpha:
yes, i liked it, too. it was exciting, but not over the top. do you know what i mean?

person beta:
mmm. that's what i thought too. i really liked the car chase, and the opening credit sequence was very exciting. and i always enjoy watching pierce brosnan.

person alpha:
oh, yes. he's brilliant. did you like the title song?

person beta:
not as much as last time, actually. what's the name of the american actor who was in the supporting role?

person alpha:
hum, edward norton, or something like that. did you like him?

person beta:
yes. he was excellent. they worked well together, don't you think?

person alpha:
i don't know. i think the woman was better. she provided a good love interest. lucky james bond!

person beta:
yes!

person alpha:
my friend jean is very beautiful.

person beta:
what's her figure?

person alpha:
perfect, and i like her charming eyes too.

person beta:
what's the color of her eyes?

person alpha:
dark blue.

person beta:
where are you going?

person alpha:
i'm going to buy a cd.

person beta:
why not listen to music online?

person alpha:
then i will have to pay quite a lot to listen to music on line, isn't it?

person beta:
you can audition music on line, and you can audition it off line after downloading it, so you needn't pay for it.

person alpha:
i have downloaded one, but it still can't be listened.

person beta:
in order to listen to music, you must have the necessary software.

person alpha:
can you recommend some to me?

person beta:
certainly. realplayer is a good.

person alpha:
can i download it?

person beta:
yes, but you need install it after downloading so that you can use it.

person alpha:
i'll try it tonight.

person beta:
what were you and richard talking about earlier? it looked intense.

person alpha:
yeah, richard said something to me that i didn't appreciate.

person beta:
oh, no. i know how insensitive he can be. what has he done now?

person alpha:
he asked me how long it took me to learn english.

person beta:
but, you were born and raised in california!

person alpha:
yeah, but i get that sometimes. it doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the u. s., we'll always be foreigners in their eyes.

person beta:
what a racist! how can you stand working with the guy?

person alpha:
you know, richard isn't such a bad guy. he made the comment out of ignorance, not malice.

person beta:
so, what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn english?

person alpha:
i told him 28 years. and, he knows i'm 28 years old since i just celebrated my birthday last week. he was puzzled for a minute, and then he got it.

person beta:
are you sure he really got the message?

person alpha:
yeah, i'm pretty sure since i then asked him how long it took him to learn english.

person beta:
that's hilarious! what did he say?

person alpha:
he said,'36 years,'and we both laughed about it. he apologized and now, it's all good.

person beta:
i'm glad. i bet he won't make that mistake again.

person alpha:
could you tell me the origin of the dragon-boat festival?

person beta:
yes, it's a way to commemorate a great ancient romantic poet, and the race is a symbol of the attempt to save him.

person alpha:
i see.did they succeed in the end?

person beta:
of course not.he drowned.

person alpha:
what can i do for you today?

person beta:
i would like to use a computer.

person alpha:
do you have your library card?

person beta:
i sure do.

person alpha:
there is a wait for the computers.

person beta:
that's all right.

person alpha:
you need to print your name on this list.

person beta:
okay. now what?

person alpha:
once a computer is available, i will let you know.

person beta:
how am i supposed to log on to the computer?

person alpha:
all you do is type in the number on the back of your card.

person beta:
that's it? thank you very much.

person alpha:
how are you doing, christopher?

person beta:
to be honest, i'm really fed up with work at the moment. i need a break!

person alpha:
are you doing anything this weekend?

person beta:
i have to work on saturday all day! i really hate my job!

person alpha:
are you available on sunday?

person beta:
yes, that's my only day off until thursday.

person alpha:
ok, well, my friends and i are planning on going to the beach on sunday. we tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere, so you could still sleep in. do you want to come with us?

person beta:
that'd be fantastic! which beach are you going to?

person alpha:
it's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city.

person beta:
what should i bring with me?

person alpha:
we've got plenty of inflatables, but if you want to sit on a chair, you'll have to bring your own sunlounger.

person beta:
i can just use my beach towel. i love lazing around in the sun.

person alpha:
do you like surfing?

person beta:
i've actually never tired. do you have a surfboard?

person alpha:
we've got a few. i can teach you how to surf on sunday. it'll be fun!

person beta:
i can't wait! it sounds like we're going to have a great time. how much money should i bring?

person alpha:
you'll just need roughly$ 10 for food and gas money. my friend is driving, so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money.

person beta:
ok, where and when should i meet you?

person alpha:
we'll pick you up at your place at noon. be there or be square!

person beta:
i'm not really accustomed to the style of the new boss.

person alpha:
it'll take us all some time to get used to the change.

person beta:
i give up! i simply can't learn french!

person alpha:
why do you say that? i think you're making a lot of progress.

person beta:
no, i'm not. i try and try and i still can't speak it very well.

person alpha:
learning any language takes a lot of effort.but don't give up. why don't we practise those dialogues together?

person beta:
good idea. that might help.

person alpha:
he said i have a big nose. i wonder what that means.

person beta:
you are interested in other people's business, aren't you?

person alpha:
does he mean i am inquisitive or i'm noisy?

person beta:
yes.

person alpha:
excuse me, i'd like to ask you a few questions about the city.

person beta:
ok, please.

person alpha:
my wife wants to take the children to go shopping, where is the best place to go?

person beta:
i would recommend the mall, it's about 20 minutes, drive to the south in a taxi. it has a wide range of shops and restaurants.

person alpha:
thank you. also, we'd like to do some sightseeing while we're in town. can you recommend some local attractions?

person beta:
how old are your children?

person alpha:
i have a 10- year-old boy and a 6- year-old girl.

person beta:
i would recommend a day at the zoo. it's fun for all the family. there is also a water park just outside the city if you would like a day trip.

person alpha:
it sounds marvelous. thank you for your help.

person beta:
boy, it looks like everyone in your family is here, from young to old.

person alpha:
easter's a good day for reunions. the family goes to church together.

person beta:
and after church they come here for lunch?

person alpha:
yup, a big potluck buffet. and then-notice there are no children around?

person beta:
yeah, what's up with that?

person alpha:
the kids wait in the house while the grownups hide these. hide away, yi-jun!

person beta:
hi! i'm happy you could make it.

person alpha:
well, i've been looking forward to seeing you.

person beta:
what can i get you?

person alpha:
i'd love a gin and tonic.

person beta:
could you please help me to check out the book?

person alpha:
sure, what's the author's name, please.

person beta:
i can't remember that clearly. it probably be charles...

person alpha:
charles dickens?

person beta:
no, no, no. i'm not interested in literature.

person alpha:
ok, do you know the title of the book?

person beta:
oh, sorry. i'm always absent-minded. i remember that i've put a note in my pocket.

person alpha:
so, show me the note please.

person beta:
i can't find it now.

person alpha:
oh, such bad luck, sir. can you please name the category of the book?

person beta:
let me see. it's not fiction. it's biography.

person alpha:
ok, i'll search it for you. a moment, please.

person beta:
thanks.

person alpha:
how do you decide what grade we get?

person beta:
i look at many things, attendance, quizzes, and tests.

person alpha:
what is the most important factor?

person beta:
obviously i look for improvement as we go along, but i would like you to do your best from the beginning.

person alpha:
how can we keep track of our grades?

person beta:
the final and midterm are 40 percent of your grade; homework, attendance, and quizzes total 60 percent.

person alpha:
what if we can't get to school?

person beta:
you can only miss one class without penalty.

person alpha:
if we have a major problem, will you let us know?

person beta:
i will be letting you know during the year if you have a major problem.

person alpha:
we're thinking about going to america.

person beta:
have you thought about the cost?

person alpha:
there is that.

person beta:
i believe it'll be very expensive.

person alpha:
may i help you with something?

person beta:
i would like to return some books.

person alpha:
i'll take them.

person beta:
here you go.

person alpha:
these books were due two weeks ago.

person beta:
yeah. i totally forgot they were due.

person alpha:
you will need to pay late fees on these books.

person beta:
how much are the late fees?

person alpha:
the fee is 25 cents every day.

person beta:
i have to pay 25 cents a day?

person alpha:
and that's for each book that is late.

person beta:
that shouldn't be a problem.

person alpha:
this is such a beautiful day! great for sailing!

person beta:
it sure is! the water looks so nice! anchor the boat for a little while. i'm going to take a dip.

person alpha:
why are you doggy-paddling? i taught you how to swim! do your breast stroke!

person beta:
i get too tired! i'll just backstroke, it's easier!

person alpha:
try kicking your legs more. that's good. don't go out too far!

person beta:
it's fine. jump in!

person alpha:
kathy! get back here! i see a shark!

person beta:
ahahah!!! help me! help! bring the boat closer! the shark is coming straight towards me!

person alpha:
it's right under you! kathy!!!

person beta:
what was your wedding ceremony like, abigail?

person alpha:
my husband and i got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses. but then we had three parties to celebrate.

person beta:
three parties? that's quite a lot. that must have been expensive!

person alpha:
well, since my husband and i are from two different countries, and we live in a third country, we decided to have one in each country. it wasn't actually that expensive.

person beta:
were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married?

person alpha:
i would have liked them to be there, but they couldn't afford to fly out to see us, and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them, so they understood.

person beta:
did your husband's family get to meet your family?

person alpha:
my husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown, so that was great. some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions, but we agreed t

person beta:
that makes sense. did you go on a honeymoon?

person alpha:
we waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to africa.

person beta:
you really didn't have a very traditional wedding, did you?

person alpha:
not at all, but we don't have a very traditional marriage either, so it suited us perfectly!

person beta:
oh, hi, jessica, are you going to see this movie too?

person alpha:
i'd love to, the movies are smash hit.

person beta:
then let's go in.

person alpha:
i can't. i'm waiting for paul, but he's late.

person beta:
i'll say the movie's starting in the minute.

person alpha:
i know. i wonder what's keeping him.

person beta:
looks like he won't show up. he's done this before, hasn't he?

person alpha:
yeah, a number of times.

person beta:
what's he trying to pull anyway.

person alpha:
i don't know. but this is definitely the last straw.

person beta:
maybe you should start seeing someone else.

person alpha:
you said it. ok, let's go in, sandy.

person beta:
so, you're applying for a b2 visa, where is your final destination and what's the purpose of your trip to the united states?

person alpha:
i'm going to visit my brother. he's just had a baby. he lives in minneapolis.

person beta:
and how long do you you plan to remain in the united states?

person alpha:
i'll be here for approximately three weeks. see, here's my return ticket for the twenty-sixth of march.

person beta:
and, who is sponsoring your trip?

person alpha:
my brother, here, this is an invitation letter from him. i will stay with him and his family in their home.

person beta:
alright, tell me about the ties you have to your home country.

person alpha:
well, i own a house. actually, i'm leaving my dog there with my neighbors. i have a car at home, and oh, my job! i'm employed by tornal as an engineer. actually, i only have three weeks'vacation, so i have to go back to work at the end of march.

person beta:
and what evidence do you have that you are financially independent?

person alpha:
well, i do have assets in my country. like i said, i own a house, and see, here's a bank statement showing my investments, and my bank balance.

person beta:
i'm sorry, sir, we cannot grant you a b2 visa at this time, instead, you are granted a resident visa! congratulations, you are the millionth person to apply for a visa! you win! congratulations!

person alpha:
good afternoon, madam. how can i help you?

person beta:
well, i am a bit out of shape. i'm thinking about getting some exercises to keep fit.

person alpha:
oh, that's good news for us.

person beta:
so what do you provide?

person alpha:
first of all, we'll design a custom-made work-out plan according to your habits.

person beta:
how can you get that done?

person alpha:
well, we give each of our customers a personal trainer who is qualified. and he will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work-out plan for your needs.

person beta:
what else?

person alpha:
since everyone is different, your personal trainer will find you a suitable type of exercise equipment and teach you all the techniques to help you achieve your fitness level and goal.

person beta:
sounds pretty good. what about the charge?

person alpha:
that depends. we offer membership for one month, half a year and one year.

person beta:
maybe one month. just have a try first. not too tough at the beginning.

person alpha:
wise decision. you'll find it's totally worth it.

person beta:
do you watch a lot of tv?

person alpha:
not really. i could take it or leave it.

person beta:
not me. i have to have my tv and watch whatever comes on.

person alpha:
how can you do that?

person beta:
hi. what's your name?

person alpha:
my name is jung min. what's your name?

person beta:
my name is jessica. it's nice to meet you.

person alpha:
yes. it's nice to meet you too. are you a new student too?

person beta:
no. i'm a sophomore. i take it you are a new student?

person alpha:
yeah. it's pretty exciting to be here.

person beta:
have fun while it lasts. the excitement wears off real quick. especially after you see how much homework you get. where are you from?

person alpha:
i'm from korea. my parents wanted me to go to an american university, so i came here.

person beta:
i have never been to korea. i've been to japan before, but never korea.

person alpha:
why were you in japan?

person beta:
my father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country. he's so into learning about different cultures.

person alpha:
that's pretty cool.

person beta:
i thought it would have been more fun if i went without my parents.

person alpha:
well, if you ever want to visit korea, i would be happy to show you around.

person beta:
thanks for the offer. i'll keep that in mind. oh, the professor is coming. we'll talk more after class.

person alpha:
ok.

person beta:
guess who i saw just now?

person alpha:
who?

person beta:
john smith, the escaped criminal.

person alpha:
that bad egg, who took the low road since he was a boy.

person beta:
i think i must report to the cops.

person alpha:
ok.

person beta:
what do you think of this one?

person alpha:
eh, so so.

person beta:
and this one? too flashy?

person alpha:
nah, not too flashy.

person beta:
hug! and this sweater from my aunt? isn't it hideous?

person alpha:
i guess.

person beta:
are you even listening? i'm trying to have a conversation with you.

person alpha:
and i'm trying to watch the game, but you're yapping on about your new clothes!

person beta:
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon!

person alpha:
well could you do me the favor of making this quick? it's the third quarter and you've been blabbering on since the first!

person beta:
oh, your precious game. you watch the same game every year, and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals!

person alpha:
oh no you didn't. you didn't just insult the sals-bury seals, did you? why don't you just. just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over?

person beta:
i might just! enjoy your stupid game!

person alpha:
hello. nice to see you again. i heard you went into hospital for a few days to undergo surgery. i hope everything's ok.

person beta:
yes, fine. i had something wrong with my stomach. i won't go into detail, but it wasn't serious.

person alpha:
i really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital.

person beta:
i think most people are a little nervous about it. i was really very, very nervous just before i had the operation, but the anaesthetist gave me an anaesthetic and the next thing i remember was waking up after the operation.

person alpha:
it must have really hurt afterwards.

person beta:
well, the nurse game me plenty of painkillers, but it did feel uncomfortable. i wasn't permitted to eat anything for 48 hours. that was the worse thing.

person alpha:
i bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital.

person beta:
i certainly was! however, the doctor gave me a list of food i couldn't eat for another 72 hours, and steak was on the list!

person alpha:
is there any pain now?

person beta:
no, not at all. i stopped taking painkillers after a couple of days.

person alpha:
did they take good care of you in the hospital?

person beta:
oh, yes. the nurse were very kind, though they were strict about what i could drink. in the end, i just drank water and nothing else. everyone was very professional and i actually enjoyed some aspects of my stay.

person alpha:
how was the party?

person beta:
i had a fantastic time.

person alpha:
hi, monica, how is everything going?

person beta:
everything goes well, but i am thinking about quitting my current job.

person alpha:
why? you're not satisfied anymore?

person beta:
i just sense. but i cannot grow anymore. my boss is not really supporting me. i am interested in some positions in other jv companies, but i need to do some more in-depth research before i send my application letters out.

person alpha:
that is important. doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application.

person beta:
certainly, it is very nice talking with you. but i really have to go now. catch you later.

person alpha:
ok, good luck to you.

person beta:
henry married rose only after her father's money, didn't he?

person alpha:
yeah. but he soon feel regretted for it.

person beta:
but he seems to be very happy with rose.

person alpha:
he is more nice than wise.

person beta:
hello, is that cathy speaking?

person alpha:
yes, is that you, allen?

person beta:
yes, how are you doing?

person alpha:
not bad.

person beta:
say i've got two tickets for the concert this evening.would you like to come with me?

person alpha:
sure.thank you very much.

person beta:
then i'll pick you up at six thirty.ok?

person alpha:
ok, see you.

person beta:
see you.

person alpha:
the weather has been terrible this week.

person beta:
yeah, i'm worried. if it's like this tomorrow, our big outdoor party will have to be canceled.

person alpha:
let's hope it clears up.

person beta:
is that pesky lady coming to the office again?

person alpha:
yeah, i'm afraid so.

person beta:
if there's one thing that bugs me, it's her critical attitude.

person alpha:
yes, it is annoying.

person beta:
hi, mr. smith. what's new?

person alpha:
nothing particular. but,...

person beta:
what's the matter?

person alpha:
i, i don't know how to explain it to you.

person beta:
go ahead. it's nothing serious. we are good friends, aren't we?

person alpha:
yes, of course. but i'm afraid i can't tell you.

person beta:
how do you do?

person alpha:
how do you do? nice to meet you, ms. smith. i'm jack stevens from the marketing department. here is my card.

person beta:
it's nice to meet you, mr. stevens.

person alpha:
please call me jack. have a seat, please.

person beta:
thank you.

person alpha:
thanks for your hospitality.

person beta:
you're welcome.

person alpha:
i'm terribly sorry to have caused you so much trouble.

person beta:
that's all right.

person alpha:
hey, what's new?

person beta:
not much. just sitting here eating some chinese food. is that the paper? why don't you open it and tell me my horoscope?

person alpha:
ok, wait a minute... let's see. i'm a taurus, and it says, mars is in the third house, and is soon to eclipse venus. i don't know what that means, but then it says, your charm and drive will win others over to your way of thinking. remember to be positive. sounds good to me.

person beta:
what about gemini? what's the prediction?

person alpha:
since mercury has crossed paths with jupiter, your fortunes are falling. bad luck will follow you today, and you will lose that which you value. be careful.

person beta:
that sounds bad! i'm really worried, what should i do? maybe i should go home and stay in the rest of the day.

person alpha:
but we have a date tonight! you can't stay at home because of a stupid horoscope.

person beta:
lily, can you take part in our picnic this weekend?

person alpha:
that sounds great. where are you going?

person beta:
i think we can go to the river, go around and have supper.

person alpha:
what should i bring?

person beta:
nothing. just wear comfortable clothes and good shoes for walking. we'll bring everything.

person alpha:
what do you think of doctor thomson?

person beta:
i feel confident of his ability to cure my daughter's disease.

person alpha:
how can you be so sure?

person beta:
i can tell form the way he spoke to us.

person alpha:
never believe his words.

person beta:
should we ask jason to play? he's always watching movies on hbo.

person alpha:
i guess we should invite him. i just hope he doesn't start talking about sylvester stallone and arnold schwarzenegger again.

person beta:
oh, come on! the game is better with three people. anyway, if we don't ask him to play, he'll be mad.

person alpha:
yeah, you're right. we'll never hear the end of it.

person beta:
what do you think about violence in movies?

person alpha:
personally, i'm not for it. i feel it's bad for kids to watch.

person beta:
but kids like watching things like that. it's just for fun, would't you say?

person alpha:
if you ask me, i have to disagree. something shouldn't be watched for fun.

person beta:
are you free tomorrow night?

person alpha:
yes, i am.

person beta:
shall we have dinner together?

person alpha:
do you have a special restaurant in mind?

person beta:
yes, i do. i know a place that has excellent food.

person alpha:
ok. i'll be happy to join you.

person beta:
if only our company prescribe flex time.

person alpha:
the board has been considering introducing flex time.

person beta:
good news. ah, what if be even better if alternative work place is provided.

person alpha:
then our entire job could be done by telecommuting.

person beta:
brian, do you know how to speak english?

person alpha:
yes.

person beta:
where did you learn?

person alpha:
i learned in college.

person beta:
you speak really well.

person alpha:
thank you.

person beta:
how long have you been in the u. s.?

person alpha:
3 weeks.

person beta:
is your wife with you?

person alpha:
yes, she just got here yesterday.

person beta:
have you been to california before?

person alpha:
no. i've never been there.

person beta:
have you ever been to las vegas?

person alpha:
yes. i went there once on a business trip.

person beta:
how are the children doing at sport?

person alpha:
i'm very pleased with their performances. timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds. that's very fast for a kid his age.

person beta:
he's not very good at the long jump though, is he?

person alpha:
he's not bad. he can jump a distance of over four meters. i think he just prefers running to jumping. jimmy's very good at the high jump. he can jump over two meters. again, that's fine for someone his age.

person beta:
two meters? that means that the high jump bar is above his head! are any of them good at long-distance running?

person alpha:
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters. a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes.

person beta:
how are they at swimming?

person alpha:
they're ok. i ask them to swim 500 meters each day. that's 20 lengths of the swimming pool. they're not very fast, but that's ok. i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape.

person beta:
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters.

person alpha:
i'd be afraid to jump from that height!

person beta:
i think that these kinds haven't learnt to be afraid yet. she started diving from a lower height, but she soon wanted to go higher.

person alpha:
it seems that they really enjoy trying to go faster, higher and further.

person beta:
hi, mary. i haven't seen you in ages! i heard that you and daniel are getting married on august 8th, the opening day of the 2008 olympic games. is it true?

person alpha:
yes, it is. we've been dating for over 7 years. we have decided to get married on a special day and we think august 8th, 2008 is a red-letter day.

person beta:
good for you! it sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time.

person alpha:
yes, there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos, wedding dress, catering, transport, hotel, etc...

person beta:
is everything ready now?

person alpha:
almost. the only thing that isn't ready is the hotel. as a lot of people have chosen that day to get married, it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive.

person beta:
have you tried the peninsula palace beijing? my wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job.

person alpha:
yes, we called, but it is booked up. the only choice is the regent beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet.

person beta:
it's an excellent hotel. a friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect, though very expensive.

person alpha:
that's why we want to have a look at other hotels. we don't want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception.

person beta:
i guess you're right. i can help you ask other hotels. i am sure there are probably some available.

person alpha:
thank you.

person beta:
my pleasure.

person alpha:
why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend?

person beta:
sorry, i thought you knew.

person alpha:
but you should have told me you were in love with her.

person beta:
didn't i?

person alpha:
you know you didn't.

person beta:
well, i'm telling you now.

person alpha:
yes, but you might have told me before.

person beta:
i didn't think you'd be interested.

person alpha:
you can't be serious.how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her?

person beta:
sorry, i didn't think it mattered.

person alpha:
oh, you men! you're all the same.

person beta:
professor, i've handed in my paper. did you read it?

person alpha:
yes. you've done a good job. but there's one thing. you should narrow down your topic.

person beta:
what about water pollution instead of pollution?

person alpha:
how's it going?

person beta:
i'm fine. thank you.

person alpha:
do you need anything?

person beta:
i need you to help me.

person alpha:
what can i do for you?

person beta:
i am looking for an article in a newspaper.

person alpha:
did you check the periodicals?

person beta:
i didn't even bother to think of that.

person alpha:
i'll show you where to find your article.

person beta:
i get lost in this library.

person alpha:
it's right this way.

person beta:
thanks a lot for your help.

person alpha:
how about eating out for a drink with me tonight.

person beta:
tonight? i'm afraid i can't. i've promised mark to go to the gym. can we make it tomorrow?

person alpha:
no problem. let's say 6:30 p. m. at the royal restaurant, ok?

person beta:
all right. see you tomorrow night.

person alpha:
hi, helen! how is it going?

person beta:
i'm very busy these days. it seems i can never finish my work.

person alpha:
well, take it easy! don't let it get on top of you.

person beta:
i'll try. i'm under a lot of pressure right now.

person alpha:
why don't you take a few days off?

person beta:
i can't. i am really behind of my work.

person alpha:
can you speak japanese?

person beta:
yes, i can, but not very well.

person alpha:
where did you learn it?

person beta:
at school. and i'm still learning it now.

person alpha:
how long have you been learning it?

person beta:
about three years.

person alpha:
can you speak any other languages?

person beta:
i'm afraid not.

person alpha:
good afternoon, johnson.

person beta:
good afternoon, mary. how's business?

person alpha:
not bad, thanks.

person beta:
i'm too tired now. i've already worked for 12 hours overtime!

person alpha:
god! don't you think they should get you an assistant?

person beta:
yes, they were supposed to, but so far nobody's turned up, and i have to do the work alone. this is the first break i've had all day.

person alpha:
they're really running you into the ground. why don't you ask for some time off? you could take a long weekend and have a good rest.

person beta:
i'm afraid i can't before i finish this project.

person alpha:
you'd better pay more attention to your health.

person beta:
i will, thanks for your concern.

person alpha:
you're welcome.

person beta:
it is too bad today.

person alpha:
what happened?

person beta:
my som was lost. i told him to stand rooted to the spot when i went shopping, but he ignored it.

person alpha:
how did you find him at last?

person beta:
it was the police wo helped me to do that.

person alpha:
it must have taught you a lesson this time.

person beta:
i want to give our kitchen the works.

person alpha:
why? i think it's convenient and good.

person beta:
no. the decoration has been out-of-date. my friends have a whole kitchen now. it's modern.

person alpha:
why should we run after the fashion?

person beta:
i am not running after the fashion. i just want a very beautiful and clean kitchen.

person alpha:
rock music really leaves me cold. what about you?

person beta:
i'm crazy about it.it makes me very excited.

person alpha:
then tell me what's good about it.

person beta:
it can't be expressed by words.

person alpha:
what's wrong with debbie today? she seems upset about something.

person beta:
i have no idea. maybe she had a fight with her husband.

person alpha:
look, here is a very special business card from an illustrator. every time i go through my book of business cards, i will notice it. it is an eye-catching one.

person beta:
wow, fantastic. i like the font and color for his name. it is creative yet personal.

person alpha:
yes, it is a bold design. people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card. it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations.

person beta:
i agree. business cards are great tools for promoting personal business. it won't take much time to design an amazing card, but it can make a big difference among the crowd. and you'll always notice it from your collection. for they have outspoken colors, own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card. i wish to have one like this. but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow.

person alpha:
morning, peter. nice suit! a new one?

person beta:
oh, yes. my wife bought it for me yesterday. hmm, you look nice in that yellow dress. yellow suits you really well.

person alpha:
maybe. several people have suggested that i get more yellow clothes. they say the color suits me because i have a fair complexion.

person beta:
that's right. you know, pink, green and black could also be good for you. actually, i think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion. it's just that different colors can give people different impressions. for example, black could make you look mature, while pink could make you look young and energetic.

person alpha:
thank you for your compliments. it sounds like you're a clothing expert.

person beta:
well, compared with my wife, i'm just a beginner.

person alpha:
did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time?

person beta:
what? why do we have to do that?

person alpha:
well, at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon. this is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth. in any case, to take better advantage of the daylight available, we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour.

person beta:
i see. that's convenient! i never understood things like this, such as gmt. i never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock!

person alpha:
that just stands for greenwich mean time. here in california, we are in pacific standard time, that is eight time zones west of greenwich. remember when we were in beijing? well, then we were in china standard time, and that's eight time zones east of greenwich!

person beta:
that's why it was so weird traveling from beijing to la! because of the huge time difference, even though we left beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours, we still arrived in la the same day at noon! it's like we went back in time!

person alpha:
i would like to watch the oscars on tv tonight. how about you?

person beta:
yes, i'd love to. it's interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good.

person alpha:
i like watching it for the fashion. i like to see what the ladies are wearing. of course, the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo.

person beta:
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours. which films do you think will win awards this year?

person alpha:
i'm really not sure. usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony, but this year there are several contenders.

person beta:
you're right. this year should be much more exciting than usual. what's you favourite award category?

person alpha:
you might think this strange, but i like the category for best foreign language film.

person beta:
it's nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood. i like the best actor and actress.

person alpha:
how many cleaning ladies does your company hire?

person beta:
we have two cleaning ladies. but both of them have received little education.

person alpha:
most cleaning ladies are illiterate. but some of them do a very nice job.

person beta:
but i actually dislike another lady. she is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own. but the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us. she would tell you what to do and where to put things.

person alpha:
how do you celebrate national day in your country?

person beta:
there are parades in many cities and people fly the national flags from almost every public building.

person alpha:
what kinds of parades are there?

person beta:
the parades are usually military ones, but sometimes there are procession of people carrying flags and singing patriotic songs. what do you do on national day in your country?

person alpha:
we don't have a national day.

person beta:
really? that's unusual.

person alpha:
i guess it is. most countries have on, but we don't.

person beta:
actually, even though we have parades, most people just use the national day holiday to visit family or go shopping. in the evening, many people watch special tv shows which celebrate national day.

person alpha:
hi melissa, are you going home this weekend?

person beta:
no, not this weekend. i have too much work to do.

person alpha:
where do your parents live?

person beta:
my father lives in washington dc.

person alpha:
how about your mother?

person beta:
my mother died two years ago.

person alpha:
oh, i am sorry to hear that. is your father still working?

person beta:
no, he's retired.

person alpha:
do you have any family here?

person beta:
yes, two of my cousins live here and my aunt and uncle live about 30 miles from here.

person alpha:
do you have any brothers or sisters?

person beta:
yes, i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister who lives in boston.

person alpha:
do you see them a lot?

person beta:
not as much as i'd like to. usually just on holidays like thanksgiving and christmas.

person alpha:
hey, how was the show?

person beta:
not great. it's a kind of boring.

person alpha:
really? i heard it was supposed to be great.

person beta:
yes, me too. but i'm disappointed.

person alpha:
what happened, john?

person beta:
nothing.

person alpha:
why do you look unhappy?

person beta:
i'm rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off.

person alpha:
oh, cheer up. he'll understand you.

person beta:
i hope so.

person alpha:
you know that? joan has got the scholarship.

person beta:
really?

person alpha:
but i think henry is a backroom boy.he always helps her with her study.

person beta:
you're right.

person alpha:
hi, tina, i've got good news. i have successfully passed the first two rounds of interview with abc company. they informed me to go to the final round next monday. it looks very promising.

person beta:
that is awesome. congratulation! i know you can make it.

person alpha:
thanks. let's go for a celebration this evening. are you free?

person beta:
yes. wait for me at the cafe down my office building. see 5pm, ok?

person alpha:
no problem. see you!

person beta:
see you!

person alpha:
do you like ethnic food?

person beta:
i do! my favorites are mexican, thai, and indian.

person alpha:
really? have you ever tried moroccan?

person beta:
i can't say that i have. what are the basic ingredients?

person alpha:
i don't know. a friend of mine said i should try it.

person beta:
do you know where a moroccan restaurant is?

person alpha:
as a matter of fact, he gave me this address.

person beta:
let's go there for lunch! i'm up for an adventure!

person alpha:
nicole, your fettucini is very... unique.

person beta:
but not as good as your mother's, right?

person alpha:
actually, it's better...

person beta:
what? are you kidding?

person alpha:
no. it was the only dish she wasn't good at. so we could use you as the new head chef...

person beta:
oh, uncle giovanni. that's wonderful! thank you! thank you!

person alpha:
ok, ok. get back to work. there's someone waiting for you in the kitchen...

person beta:
how many people are there in your family?

person alpha:
five.my father, mother, brother, sister-in-law and me.

person beta:
is your brother older or younger than you?

person alpha:
he is five years older than me, he got married last sunday.my brother and my sister-in-law are the same age.

person beta:
hello, tom. where are you heading for?

person alpha:
i am going to a movie theater. you know there is a new action film produced by hollywood. a thriller, really.

person beta:
another terror film? there is too much terror and violence in the films. do you like seeing such a picture?

person alpha:
i don't really like seeing bloody frames, but i appreciate the lifelike frames simulated with the highly skillful special effects.

person beta:
did you go to the concert last weekend?

person alpha:
no, i didn't. and you? was it good?

person beta:
yes. i did. i enjoyed it a lot.there was a folk singer, a violinist and a pianist.

person alpha:
how much was the ticket?

person beta:
i only paid two dollars for mine.

person alpha:
mary and tom are breaking up.

person beta:
it's unbelievable! they are only married for one month. then who is at fault?

person alpha:
mary said she couldn't put up with tom, for he fell in love with another woman.

person beta:
do you think they'll become reconciled?

person alpha:
no, i don't think so. she said she would rather be single than cope with an unhappy marriage.

person beta:
what a shame! their marriage is really a mistake.

person alpha:
have you ever been invited to a chinese feast?

person beta:
sure. beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality.

person alpha:
as far as you could see, is dining at a chinese table a distinct experience? to what extent does it differ from that in your homeland?

person beta:
to begin with, i have to use chopsticks.

person alpha:
but you look quite proficient in using them now.

person beta:
certainly. after all, i've been here for two years. it's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to chinese dinner utensils. though, i do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a ch

person alpha:
yes, table etiquette. there are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told. some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to westerners, while they are the norm i

person beta:
anything strang about that?

person alpha:
maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate. they resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices. it's very inauspicious, and might enrage all present.

person beta:
oh, sorry! there's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks.

person alpha:
it really makes my blood boil when this sort of thing happens. i even want to wring his neck.

person beta:
don't be so angry. it's passed anyway.

person alpha:
i can't forget it.

person beta:
you'd better cool yourself down first.

person alpha:
let's program your courses. since you have had english literature, you should take american literature and american prose and fiction.you transcript indicate that your english background is strong, so i don't think you have any problem with it.

person beta:
how many credits for each course?

person alpha:
three, you also should take two three-credit-course in education department.

person beta:
thank you, sir, i'm sure i will.

person alpha:
i hate to go outside.

person beta:
me too.

person alpha:
why do you hate to go outside?

person beta:
i meet too many jerks.

person alpha:
i agree.

person beta:
this city is full of jerks.

person alpha:
rude people are everywhere.

person beta:
but what can you do?

person alpha:
you can yell at them.

person beta:
and they will yell back at you.

person alpha:
yelling doesn't do any good.

person beta:
no. the best thing to do is just stay home.

person alpha:
i had to announce his innocence in court today, but it left a nasty taste in my mouth.

person beta:
you mean you suspect him.

person alpha:
i'm not sure. i'll try to prove my feeling.

person beta:
i hope i can do something for you.

person alpha:
actually i have a passion for chinese literature.

person beta:
you do?

person alpha:
yeah, those classics from the great writers.

person beta:
but i find japanese ones better.

person alpha:
jack wonders whether linda likes him or not.

person beta:
why doesn't he ask her?

person alpha:
he is too scared to ask her.

person beta:
he's a chicken guy.

person alpha:
good morning.

person beta:
what does the paper say?

person alpha:
nothing much-- the same old stuff. a lot of bad news as usual.

person beta:
well, what's the weather report?

person alpha:
sunny and mild today, cloudy and rainy tomorrow.

person beta:
did they find those bank robbers?

person alpha:
not yet. they were holding two men in ohio, but they let them go. they weren't the criminals after all.

person beta:
what about the sports page? what were the scores of last night's games?

person alpha:
here's the paper; you can read them yourself.

person beta:
i would wondering if you like to stay here for a few days.

person alpha:
it really depends on when and how long

person beta:
until next weekend. that's ok.

person alpha:
they'll do the operation for you this friday.

person beta:
but saturday is my birthday.

person alpha:
i think it's important to do now. we can have a birthday party for you when you come out of the hospital.

person beta:
but it won't be on my birthday.

person alpha:
but your health is more important. believe me!

person beta:
i hate computer games.

person alpha:
why? they are fine.

person beta:
because they are too violent. some of them are even disgusting.

person alpha:
indeed there are bad games. but many of them are good.

person beta:
if boys grow up with computer games, they will surely become bad.

person alpha:
come on. things are not so bad. boys can learn to use the computer through games.

person beta:
are you free this weekend, miss rose?

person alpha:
yes, i am. what's up?

person beta:
then would you please go to a dance party with me?

person alpha:
with pleasure. i suppose you dance often.

person beta:
oh, no. as a matter of fact, i haven't danced for a long time.

person alpha:
but i am told that you dance wonderfully well.

person beta:
thanks for flattering me. i think you dance a lot, right?

person alpha:
no. just occasionally.

person beta:
what's your favorite dance?

person alpha:
it's hard to say, but i do love the foxtrot and waltz.

person beta:
how about rock'n'roll?

person alpha:
to tell you the truth, i don't like it. it's too noisy.

person beta:
and the tango?

person alpha:
oh, it's really beautiful, but i just can't do it well.

person beta:
don't be so modest. i'm sure you can do it very well. then i'll meet you at six. is that at all right?

person alpha:
ok.

person beta:
great! i'm your lucky fellow then.

person alpha:
you are an outgoing person, quite easy to talk with.

person beta:
yes, my friends like to get along with me well.

person alpha:
do you have many friends?

person beta:
yes, i like to make new friends.

person alpha:
what do you usually do with them?

person beta:
we like to get together, chat and enjoy beautiful music.

person alpha:
doris, helen mall is having a big sale this weekend. do you wanna go?

person beta:
don't feel like it. i'm broke.

person alpha:
well, we can still do some window shopping, can we?

person beta:
just look around? nah, that's boring.

person alpha:
i'll go by myself then.

person beta:
i feel like going for a drink, it's been a long day.

person alpha:
great idea! peter, i could use the drink.

person beta:
how about the new bar across the road?

person alpha:
sounds good. the food there is fantastic too.

person beta:
i agree, i had lunch there last week.

person alpha:
excellent! that sounds like a plan.

person beta:
hello, are you chinese?

person alpha:
no, i'm korean. where are you from?

person beta:
i'm from america. are you settling in all right?

person alpha:
i've already found a flat and it's quite comfortable. what about you?

person beta:
i live in my uncle's house. he came here ten years ago.

person alpha:
what do you think of the local accent here? has it been causing you any problems?

person beta:
i think it's just a matter of getting used to it.

person alpha:
i can't agree more.

person beta:
why don't you watch where you're going?

person alpha:
me? you're the one who pulled out in front of me!

person beta:
there was plenty of room for me to pull out.you didn't have to stay in the lane you were in.

person alpha:
hey, listen. i had every right to stay in the lane i was in.you were supposed to wait until i passed to pull out.and anyhow, you didn't give me any time to change lanes.all of a sudden--bang--there you are right in front of me.

person beta:
i think my arm is broken.

person alpha:
sorry about your arm, but it serves you right. you need to learn how to drive. you're lucky you didn't get killed. and i'm lucky to be alive too.

person beta:
listen, let's just wait until the police get here.then we can decide whose fault this accident was.

person alpha:
fine with me. i know the laws of the road. i'm not worried.

person beta:
i have a cell phone in my car. now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.why don't you get it for me, and then i can call the police?

person alpha:
alright.

person beta:
it doesn't work. it looks like it's broken. i need to get to a hospital. you should drive me there.

person alpha:
oh, yeah? it's better if we make a police report first. then you can go to the hospital.

person beta:
damn it! i'm injured here. we could wait all day for the police.

person alpha:
well, you'll just have to wait. i'm not going to move my car until the police arrive. i'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone. don't worry. you'll get to the hospital in time.

person beta:
it really hurts.

person alpha:
yes, maybe it does.but if you're going to drive like you did just now, you will have to get used to a little physical pain. you know what i mean?

person beta:
to hell with you. the accident was your fault.

person alpha:
i'm afraid it wasn't. and when the police get here, you will also see that it wasn't. but enough of this bickering. i'm going to go find a phone.don't move that arm while i'm gone. alright?

person beta:
to hell with you.

person alpha:
bill, do you know if the cafeteria around the corner's open today?

person beta:
yes. they were open this morning when i came to work. they must've finished remodeling. why do you want to know?

person alpha:
well, i thought that maybe we could go there for lunch today. that is, if you haven't promised to go with someone else.

person beta:
that'd be wonderful, peter. but i hope you're in a better mood than you were this morning.

person alpha:
i'm sorry i was such a grouch. it must've been the weather. when it rains i get depressed.

person beta:
forget it. i'll see you at 11:30 am.

person alpha:
the stepmother was very wicked. she couldn't stand a happy smile on the boy's face.

person beta:
and?

person alpha:
and she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy.

person beta:
poor child!

person alpha:
sorry. i didn't mean to be late. can i come in?

person beta:
what's your excuse this time?

person alpha:
have i used the one that my sister is sick?

person beta:
yes, twice last week.

person alpha:
are you sure? i thought i said it was my mother.

person beta:
i don't think so. but it could've been.

person alpha:
well. you can trust me this time. my sister is definitely sick. i'm just coming from the hospital. they say she might even die.

person beta:
i don't buy your story. try not to have any more sick relatives this week, all right?

person alpha:
i'll do my best.

person beta:
just try to be a little more punctual in the future.

person alpha:
i'm working on it. really!

person beta:
hi, becky, what's up?

person alpha:
not much, except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall.

person beta:
what's the problem?

person alpha:
she loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that i do. i can never do anything right when she's around.

person beta:
for example?

person alpha:
well, last week i invited her over to dinner. my husband and i had no problem with the food, but if you listened to her, then it would seem like i fed her old meat and rotten vegetables. there's just nothing can please her.

person beta:
no, i can't see that happening. i know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen.

person alpha:
it's not just that. she also criticizes how we raise the kids.

person beta:
my mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us. if it wasn't disciplining them enough, then we were disciplining them too much. she also complained about the food we fed them, the schools we sent them too, and everything else under the sun.

person alpha:
ella, it's been such a long week. i'm ready to go out and party. hey, let's go out for a night on the town.

person beta:
gosh, you took all the word right out of my mouth. let's go out and get crazy tonight.

person alpha:
let's go to the new club on west street.

person beta:
sure, but what do i wear?

person alpha:
you can wear that pretty red dress.

person beta:
hi, alice, what are you doing this sunday?

person alpha:
nothing really, why, what's up?

person beta:
if you are free, maybe you would like to go to a small party and having for my birthday party. it will be fun, you will get to know lots of people.

person alpha:
sounds great, i'd very much like to accept your invitation, thanks, when?

person beta:
around six pm.

person alpha:
do you need help setting up or anything? i don't mind. i like to do that kind of thing. it's fun and i have a good eye for decorating.

person beta:
no. thank you. i can handle it, but thanks for the offer.

person alpha:
ok, i will see you then.

person beta:

person alpha:
hello.this is susan.

person beta:
hello, i'm mark. i'm just wondering if you are free this weekend

person alpha:
yes, i think so.

person beta:

person alpha:
what's the time?

person beta:
six thirty, tonight.

person alpha:
oh, i'm sorry i can't because i have to do some housework.you can ask jenny to go with you

person beta:
all right.maybe next time i can go with you.bye!

person alpha:
good bye!

person beta:
what is life?

person alpha:
don't ask such a question. you know it has no certain answer. everyone knows it is in his heart.

person beta:
then do you think that life is arranged by something above us.

person alpha:
maybe, the whirligig of time, who knows?

person beta:
right.

person alpha:
david, i'm going to china.

person beta:
really? how did you get the chance?

person alpha:
you know. i took part in the chinese contest. i was the best and they gave me this reward. i don't have to pay for my trip.

person beta:
congratulations. how lucky you are!

person alpha:
thank you. i'm leaving tomorrow morning.

person beta:
i'm sure you'll enjoy the trip. china is such a beautiful country.

person alpha:
i'm sure i will.

person beta:
have a nice journey, lily.

person alpha:
thank you, david.

person beta:
did you watch the final last night? my favorite singer won!

person alpha:
oh, i love him too. he not only sings well but also shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest.

person beta:
yeah, he got booted after his initial performance in the audition, but he did not give up. he then tried at another two auditions.

person alpha:
he had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest. fortunately, in the third audition, he has won popularity among the audience. and that's when i started to notice him.

person beta:
me too.

person alpha:
before he made the top three, i was so nervous. i just fear that he might be knocked out.

person beta:
yeah, there're so many excellent candidates out there. who knows which one will make it to the final?

person alpha:
absolutely. that's why when he entered the final, i was so excited.

person beta:
he really did a great job in the finale, especially in the pk round. he performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him.

person alpha:
and the host announced that he won it all!

person beta:
come in, come in!

person alpha:
hi, gary, what happened? i was waiting for you at the theater. why didn't you meet me there?

person beta:
i thought we were supposed to meet here.

person alpha:
don't you know our movie starts at seven? and we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven. then it doesn't make sense to meet at the apartment.

person beta:
i'm sorry. we must have misunderstood each other.

person alpha:
why don't you try to be clearer about your intentions?

person beta:
you're right. i am sorry. let's go and watch the movie.

person alpha:
it's okay. i don't want to go now. we've already missed ten minutes of the movie. i don't want to see a movie without watching the beginning.

person beta:
excuse me, i am a new student here. could you tell me where the english department is?

person alpha:
it is in that brand new, tall building over there. on the 9th floor.

person beta:
where is the school cafeteria?

person alpha:
it is the basement of that red building in front of the tower with big bells.

person beta:
where is the computer center?

person alpha:
the computer center is on the first floor of the library.

person beta:
where is the library?

person alpha:
the library is next to the adminstration building. the adminstration building is over there near the school's main entrance. there are school maps for free in the lobby of the admin.

person beta:
thank you. i will go get one.

person alpha:
sure. glad to be of service. by the way, my name is mike sullivan. you will see me around a lot. i am running for president of the student government.

person beta:
well, hi! my name is eve markowski. i am glad to meet you. with your friendly smile and helpful attitude. i am sure you will win.

person alpha:
thanks you for the encouragement.

person beta:
you are welcome. i'd better go. goodbye.

person alpha:
have a good day. bye-bye!

person beta:
how about another beer?

person alpha:
no, thanks. i've had more than enough.in fact, i must be running along.

person beta:
stay around for a while.the party is warming up.

person alpha:
i'm afraid i have to leave. i have to be up early tomorrow.

person beta:
we have another traditional holiday-the dragon boat festival.

person alpha:
when is it?

person beta:
it falls on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month.

person alpha:
could you tell me the origin of the two festivals?

person beta:
ok. the dragon boat festival is a way to commemorate a great ancient poet named quyuan. on that day, people will hold a boat race as a symbol of the attempt to save him who threw himself into the river.

person alpha:
why do people eat rice cakes on that day?

person beta:
in order to prevent the fish from eating the poet's body.

person alpha:
it sounds so moving.

person beta:
nice to see you, patrick.

person alpha:
bob! i hear your team won the match.

person beta:
yeah. all of us tried our best.

person alpha:
congratulations!

person beta:
i think you're being a little naive.

person alpha:
if i want, i can protect myself by paying through an escrow account, which holds the money until i receive the item.

person beta:
that proves my point! protect yourself or you'll get burned.

person alpha:
ebay also offers free insurance. you can get a refund of up to$ 200 if you're not satisfied with your purchase.

person beta:
$ 200? if they get a hold of your credit card number, you're going to be out a lot more than$ 200! i had a friend who...

person alpha:
your knowledge of english is really surprising.

person beta:
oh, it's nothing to speak of.

person alpha:
no, seriously. i am impressed.

person beta:
thank you. i appreciate the compliment.

person alpha:
hello?

person beta:
hey tina. what are you doing?

person alpha:
i was just watching tv. what's going on with you?

person beta:
i just watched a movie and i'm scared.

person alpha:
what did you watch?

person beta:
i saw the sixth sense. i didn't know it was going to be so scary.

person alpha:
i remember that. it was a great movie. but it was definitely scary.

person beta:
if you're not busy, do you want to come over? i'm afraid to be alone.

person alpha:
sure. i can come over. what should we do?

person beta:
how about if we watch a comedy. i need something to get my mind off the frightening images i have from the sixth sense.

person alpha:
ok. i'll get ready and leave. i'll see you in about 20 minutes.

person beta:
hurry, ok. it's dark out.

person alpha:
don't worry, nothings going to happen. i'll be there real soon.

person beta:
ok. see you soon.

person alpha:
are you a blogger?

person beta:
sure i am. i've been writing a blog for almost three years.

person alpha:
oh, it seems that i'm the only one who never blogs. when did you get started?

person beta:
i began blogging when i first went to the us for my graduate strides.

person alpha:
what do you usually write about?

person beta:
at first, i'll write about my life there. like interesting things on the campus, travel stories, special english words that i come across. sometimes, i'll post my pictures on my blog so my family an

person alpha:
that's interesting. how often do you write a blog?

person beta:
it's random. if there happen to be a lot of things going on, i may add several new entries in a week, and if i've got nothing to share, i may leave my blog untouched for weeks.

person alpha:
got it. are you still updating your blog?

person beta:
sure, since i came back from the us, i've been keeping the habit of blogging, simply to share my personal insights on any topic i like.

person alpha:
good for you. i know many people just leave their blogs alone after the first few months.

person beta:
have you found a new job yet?

person alpha:
no, not yet. i'm still looking. i've been doing some work through a temp-agency though.

person beta:
what kind of work?

person alpha:
i'm temping at a pharmaceutic company.

person beta:
what do you do there?

person alpha:
mostly office work- filing and so on.

person beta:
how long is the assignment?

person alpha:
till the end of the month.

person beta:
this is just for you. cheers! bottoms up.

person alpha:
en... it tastes good. i appreciate what you have done for me.

person beta:
i'm sorry, ladies. mr. smith's viewing is over. it ended an hour ago.

person alpha:
but we just drove across town. can't we just go in to see him one last...

person beta:
i'm afraid not. but at tomorrow's funeral, the family requested an open casket service.

person alpha:
this is all too fast. he's my best friend, and now he's gone.

person beta:
i'm sorry. i know it must have come as a great shock.

person alpha:
the viewing was for saying goodbye, and i didn't even get that.

person beta:
i can't bear it. the driver is too bad.

person alpha:
he must be green. it's lucky that we will get off soon.

person beta:
i prefer potatoes to eggplants.

person alpha:
i feel eggplants are more nutritious.

person beta:
but as a matter of fact, potatoes taste better.

person alpha:
oh, that's how you see it.

person beta:
that way they look longer.

person alpha:
now what are you doing?

person beta:
putting on mascara.

person alpha:
nasty. you'd better not rub your eyes.

person beta:
i won't.

person alpha:
and you'd better not cry or you'll have black streaks running down your face.

person beta:
let's have some lunch; do you know of a great restaurant somewhere?

person alpha:
yes, i'm hungry. what types of food sound good?

person beta:
maybe just a quick sandwich, salad, or something.

person alpha:
i have a great idea of where you might like to go.

person beta:
can we walk there?

person alpha:
it's on the second floor. may i join you?

person beta:
of course! let's go.

person alpha:
let's hurry. i'm starving!

person beta:
what are you going to do next year?

person alpha:
i want to go traveling.

person beta:
do you have any where in mind?

person alpha:
yes, i've been thinking about florida.

person beta:
like a cat on hot bricks, as you might say. i don't believe you are listening at all.

person alpha:
sorry, i just worried about him. you know, he should be here an hour ago.

person beta:
don't worry him, he has been grown up and i think he can take himself very well.

person alpha:
but he still does not come back.

person beta:
maybe he is on the way home now.

person alpha:
how long have you been in england?

person beta:
for almost two years.

person alpha:
almost two years? your english is very good.

person beta:
thank you. but there's still a lot for me to learn.

person alpha:
the johnson are on their way back.you remember them, don't you?

person beta:
johnson? i can't place them.

person alpha:
we met them in bermuda last may.

person beta:
they've completely slipped my mind.

person alpha:
the couple with the dogs, think back.

person beta:
no, i don't recall a thing about them.

person alpha:
well, i've invited them for brunch.

person beta:
hmm, i must be getting absent-minded.

person alpha:
his grandfather is the richest person in the area.

person beta:
what a miser! he cycles to school every day.

person alpha:
his grandfather's money is not his.

person beta:
i can't understand him anyway.

person alpha:
what did he say?

person beta:
he said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man.

person alpha:
it's too good to be true! if i were there, i would ask him if he himself was a successful man.

person beta:
nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question, you know.

person alpha:
i wonder what he looks like. oh, i can't wait to see him! his email said he'd be wearing a white hat.oh, there he is.

person beta:
hey, isabelle...

person alpha:
logan! why on earth are you hiding here? white hat! come on! don't tell me you're the guy! it can't be true.

person beta:
yes, i am the guy...

person alpha:
what a bummer! you set me up?

person beta:
let me explain. i didn't mean to hurt you...

person alpha:
we are just going round the corner for a drink. won't you join us?

person beta:
well, i'd like to, but i am not sure i have time.

person alpha:
oh, come on! just a quick one!

person beta:
all right, just a quick one.

person alpha:
excuse me miao li. could you tell me who jackie chan is?

person beta:
certainly. jackie chan is a very famous movie star in hong kong. his chinese name is cheng long.

person alpha:
ha, i know cheng long a lot, he has made 40 films since 1976. and at that time he was promoted as the new bruce lee. but i'm not familiar with his english name.

person beta:
ok. then tell me what else you know.

person alpha:
some movie stars measure their worth by how many millions of dollars they make. do you know how jackie chan measures his worth?

person beta:
he measures his worth by how many of his bones he has fractured while executing his film, incredible stunts. by the way, can you count the breaks?

person alpha:
sure. his skull, his eyes, his nose, three times, his jaw, his shoul-der, is chest, two fingers, a knee. as he said'everything from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet!'

person beta:
indeed you know much about him.

person alpha:
this is because he is the action-movie incarnate or action-star extraordinaire around the world.

person beta:
i'm sorry, but i can't find the book you lent me.

person alpha:
oh, that's all right.

person beta:
i must apologize. i'll buy you a new one tomorrow.

person alpha:
no, please don't. i couldn't let you do that.

person beta:
may i ask a question?

person alpha:
yes, what's it?

person beta:
what does mph stand for?

person alpha:
it's miles per hour.

person beta:
look, that bamboo groves are flourishing. let's go and play there.

person alpha:
wait! look at that board, what's on it?

person beta:
'please don't enter the bamboo groves.'we're not allowed to go in.

person alpha:
then we'd better not go.

person beta:
ok.

person alpha:
are you ready to go shopping?

person beta:
not yet. i'm not finished with my research yet.

person alpha:
what research?

person beta:
reading my fashion magazines! how do you think i know so much about all the latest trends?

person alpha:
but they're just ads.

person beta:
duh... that's the point. the people in the ads are wearing what's in. plus, there are articles on new trends.

person alpha:
is there anything worth watching on another channel?

person beta:
i think there's a western on.

person alpha:
do you mind if we watch it. i'd really like to see it.

person beta:
well, i really wanted to see the football game.

person alpha:
football game? ok, and you know what comes on next?

person beta:
i believe there's a sitcom.

person alpha:
are you interested in watching it?

person beta:
let me look in the tv guide first.

person alpha:
oh, i am sorry. what's on channel 2 at 10 pm?

person beta:
if i remember correctly, it's a quiz show.

person alpha:
do you want to watch it?

person beta:
let's watch it together.

person alpha:
well, how did you enjoy your seaside trip?

person beta:
it was funny.

person alpha:
tell me about it, will you?

person beta:
well, we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning. it was a magnificent sight.

person alpha:
did you stop at the big waterfall for pictures?

person beta:
sure, we wouldn't miss it for anything. after that, we took a short cut to the park. there was very little traffic, so we got there in less than an hour.

person alpha:
you were lucky then. what did you do after that?

person beta:
we went for a swim in the sea. that was the best part of the day. just look at my nice tan.

person alpha:
so you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday.

person beta:
yes, you're right. and i was so tired that i fell asleep on the way back. my arms are still stiff from the swim yesterday.

person alpha:
susan is going to get a divorce.

person beta:
how do you know that?

person alpha:
she told me that peter and she has a quarrel last nigh, and she left this morning, bag and baggage.

person beta:
oh, i see. but i think you are making a fuss. they will make it up. bet it.

person alpha:
here's the course description guide.

person beta:
what do i do with it?

person alpha:
do you want me to help you?

person beta:
please.

person alpha:
look. here are the core classes. everyone has to take them.

person beta:
so i don't have to worry about them.

person alpha:
you're catching on! however, there are elective courses like wood shop, metal shop, home economics...

person beta:
i'll take home economics.

person alpha:
good. now you can pick classes by yourself.

person beta:
well, known, jim, i'm... i'm pretty much in favour of your computers, i think computers teach kids to think, because they require logical thoughts.

person alpha:
but i... i don't agree with thatbecause computers weaken kids'ability to thinkbecause kids don't learn basic skills.

person beta:
what do you mean?

person alpha:
they can't spell, they can't add, they can't subtract, they even don't remember any more. that's because they rely on gadgets.

person beta:
that's not the gadgets. creating programmes is stimulate thoughts. it engages their imagination and sharpen their mind.

person alpha:
ann, do you have time next monday?

person beta:
yeah, what's up?

person alpha:
next monday is my birthday, and i would like you to attend my party.

person beta:
wow. i'd love to.

person alpha:
great!

person beta:
when and where?

person alpha:
five o'clock that afternoon, and in my place, you know?

person beta:
yes, i know. i appreciate your invitation.

person alpha:
i am going to invite other guys. see you that day.

person beta:
see you.

person alpha:
hey stacy. what's going on?

person beta:
i'm pretty tired these days.

person alpha:
why? you're not working so don't you have a lot of time on your hands?

person beta:
i have so much house work to do. i have to take care of the kids, cook, clean, laundry, and the cycle never ends.

person alpha:
how about your husband. does he help much?

person beta:
not at all. he comes home and complains about his hard day at work. he expects me to do everything. he even wants me to feed him sometimes. can you believe that?

person alpha:
that sucks.

person beta:
if he wasn't so lazy, i think i wouldn't have any complaints. he mows the lawn, but can you believe he tried to convince me to do it?

person alpha:
that's crossing the line.

person beta:
oh well. i'll have to live with it. what else can i do?

person alpha:
do you like watching the winter olympic games?

person beta:
of course. it's the tradition game in winter, and with good reason. don't you like watching it?

person alpha:
of course i do. i love it. all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable.

person beta:
that's true. for various reasons, it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics. you know, the low temperature may cause many problems.

person alpha:
yeah. what's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics?

person beta:
when the olympic games started in modern times, only summer events were included. when it grew popular, there came the winter olympic games, which includes a variety of winter sports.

person alpha:
i see. then, what's your favorite winter sport?

person beta:
figure skating. in my eye, nothing beats it.

person alpha:
then you must know shen due and hao hongbo.

person beta:
oh, i didn't expect you to know them. but yes, i love them not only because of many medals they've won, but also because of many medals they've won, but also because of their spirits.

person alpha:
you should go to talk with may. she is a big fan of them too.

person beta:
how do you arrange this summer vacation?

person alpha:
i want to travel.

person beta:
where would you like to go?

person alpha:
the seaside.

person beta:
that's really a good idea. taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good. i recommend you qingdao or dalian.

person alpha:
i've been to qingdao before, so i'll choose dalian. i've heard that the environment there is very good.

person beta:
yes, that's a good place to spend a holiday. last year i went there. it's really.

person alpha:
thank you!

person beta:
would you care for something to drink, mr. stone?

person alpha:
no, thank you, mrs. carter. i'm fine for now.

person beta:
just make yourself at home. the other guests should be arriving shortly.

person alpha:
i'm dreadfully sorry for you.

person beta:
thank you very much for your kindness.

person alpha:
is there any clue?

person beta:
no, he left nothing.

person alpha:
very glad to know something about you, then what are you going to do when you finish.

person beta:
oh, i'll go to shanghai to practice there.

person alpha:
that's a good idea. it must be easy to find a job in shanghai.

person beta:
i think so, you know there is a great deal of opportunity for business there.

person alpha:
and english is very useful in your job.

person beta:
i think it will be very useful in many ways. beside, shanghai is an important trade center, not only in china, but also in the world, english is useful in almost all walks of life.

person alpha:
you will be a very promising one.

person beta:
that's my wish.

person alpha:
i hear you are expecting your family.

person beta:
yes, my parents, and soon my brother as well.

person alpha:
i didn't know you had a brother.

person beta:
oh, yes, he is two years older than me. he lives in new zealand so i don't see him that often.

person alpha:
oh, nice. is he coming on his own or with the family?

person beta:
his son is coming as well. he wants to go to university here in england so they will visit a few universities while they are here.

person alpha:
does your brother have just one son?

person beta:
no, he has two daughters as well. his wife and daughters are visiting her parents. so i won't see them.

person alpha:
i'm sure your parents are looking forward to seeing their grandson.

person beta:
oh yes, they are really looking forward to it. they went to new zealand last year and loved it.

person alpha:
so when are they all coming?

person beta:
my parents are already here. my brother and nephew are arriving on monday.

person alpha:
you seem to very busy these days. what are you doing?

person beta:
i am swapped with work after 10- day holiday.

person alpha:
where did you spend your holiday?

person beta:
i went to paris.

person alpha:
so, paula, where are you from?

person beta:
i'm from canada, originally.

person alpha:
from canada? where were you born?

person beta:
montreal.

person alpha:
when did you come to los angeles?

person beta:
we moved here when i was fourteen.

person alpha:
did you go to school here?

person beta:
well, i went to high school here, but i went to college in texas.

person alpha:
did you get a job right after graduation?

person beta:
no, i traveled for a while in europe after college, and then i lived in france.

person alpha:
when was that?

person beta:
let's see... that was about six years ago.

person alpha:
i bet that was interesting. what did you do there?

person beta:
i studied french. anyway... that's enough about me.how about you? were you born in l. a.?

person alpha:
do you consider yourself a good mother?

person beta:
yes, i'm a very good mother and successful career woman.

person alpha:
how can you manage to do both? i mean, it is so hard to be a working mother.

person beta:
i think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself, like keeping housework simple, spending money on things that make life easier, buying yourself things you like, and so on. you can only be nice to others when you can be nice to yourself.

person alpha:
does your husband feel the same?

person beta:
yes. he is very understanding and supportive.

person alpha:
i find it really hard to express myself in class. i have lots of ideas, but they never seem to come out of my mouth.

person beta:
let me give you a little advice. you know what the topics are going to be, so prepares what you would like to say in advance.

person alpha:
i often do, but i'm worried about the responses from other people.

person beta:
you have to be realistic. not everyone is going to agree with you, but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion.

person alpha:
i'm worried that what i say will not make sense.

person beta:
we could chat about the topic before class. i could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking.

person alpha:
that's a good idea. what should i do if i am in two minds about a topic?

person beta:
that's easy. express possibilities. people will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle.

person alpha:
i didn't realize that speaking in class could be so easy.

person beta:
the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say. they will reply to your statements, but you can't be sure how.

person alpha:
what's his job?

person beta:
he used to be a policeman.

person alpha:
but mrs.smith hired him to find her lost son.

person beta:
yeah. he's a private eye now.

person alpha:
bother the flies!

person beta:
where do they come from?

person alpha:
i don't know. something rotten here?

person beta:
i can't see it.

person alpha:
have you got your invitation yet?

person beta:
my invitation? no, i haven't. my invitation to what?

person alpha:
the house warming party.

person beta:
whose house warming party is it?

person alpha:
tom and bill smith. they are both working now you know? and they've bought a new house.

person beta:
oh, they have? i didn't know. i haven't seen tom lately.

person alpha:
it's out in the suburbs.

person beta:
have you seen the house?

person alpha:
yes, i have. i went out with them last weekend.

person beta:
is it nice?

person alpha:
yes, it is. there are three bedrooms, a living room, a dining room, and a big kitchen.

person beta:
there's also a garden.

person alpha:
well, that does sound nice. have they moved in yet?

person beta:
they are moving today. tom's taken the day off. he's rented a truck, and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight.

person alpha:
when are they going to have the party?

person beta:
next saturday night. you should get your invitation today or tomorrow.

person alpha:
wow, that would be something to look forward to.

person beta:
hi, darling! i have a one-month vacation saved up. how about a trip to europe?

person alpha:
i could go for that. but i'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year.

person beta:
oh, but i really need to leave this town for a change. working day after day has worn me out. do you have any other suggestions?

person alpha:
we should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away. how about the countryside? there must be many interesting places, and we could enjoy the fresh air and the delicious local spec

person beta:
wonderful! i think that's a great idea. how soon until we can make this happen? i can't wait!

person alpha:
tomorrow i have an appointment with my dentist. what about next monday?

person beta:
perfect. i'll start preparing tomorrow. if we're going to drive, i'll need to fill up the tank.

person alpha:
no need. i think it's still plenty full. even so, i'd rather travel by bus or train. it would cost much less than driving. oil prices are soaring nowadays, you know.

person beta:
we can take the train, that will be faster. i'll book the tickets tomorrow morning.

person alpha:
great! oh, one more thing, don't forget to check the weather before we go. i'd hate to get caught in the rain.

person beta:
no problem. i'm really looking forward to the coming week.

person alpha:
me, too. now let's make a list for what we need to take with us.

person beta:
hi, kenny. let's go for a drink.

person alpha:
sounds good. where are we going?

person beta:
somewhere new. it's a great place to pick up chicks.

person alpha:
need a new. girlfriend, huh?

person beta:
yeah, i broke up with lisa.she blew a gasket over it. whoa, get a load of that!

person alpha:
whew! that getup is terrific!

person beta:
never mind the getup.she's beautiful!

person alpha:
that too.

person beta:
i'm gonna introduce myself.

person alpha:
if you're lucky, that might do the trick.

person beta:
oh, oh, that tears it! i'm getting out of here.

person alpha:
hold on! what's the big hurry?

person beta:
my ex-girlfriend's here.if she sees me, my goose is cooked.

person alpha:
i wanna finish my drink first. i'll meet you at sammy's.

person beta:
ok, catch you later.

person alpha:
valerie! hi! wow how are you? it's been such a long time!

person beta:
darlene! indeed, it's been a while! how have you been? wow, you look amazing! i love what you've done with your hair!

person alpha:
really? thanks! i went to that hair salon that you told me about, but enough about me! look at you! you haven't aged a day since the last time i saw you! what is your secret!

person beta:
ha ha, come on! well, i've been watching what i eat, and working out three times a week. by the way, i heard your son recently graduated!

person alpha:
yes, my little paul is finally a doctor. they grow up so fast you know.

person beta:
he is such a handsome guy. he gets his looks from his mother of course!

person alpha:
thank you! what about your daughter, pamela? i heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently.

person beta:
oh yes. she had a beautiful wedding in cozumel mexico and we all attended.

person alpha:
such a lovely girl. i hope my paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday!

person beta:
but of course! well, it's been great talking to you, but i have to get going.

person alpha:
same here! we will catch up soon, maybe over coffee!

person beta:
that would be great! give me a call!

person alpha:
see you soon! bye! egg... i can't stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter.

person beta:
did you already take the history exam?

person alpha:
yeah. it was hard. when do you take it?

person beta:
i take it tomorrow morning. there is so much material that i dont know what to emphasize on. what types of questions did you get?

person alpha:
mostly on the civil war. you should also study the impact martin luther king jr. had on american society.

person beta:
what about abraham lincoln? did you get any questions about him?

person alpha:
i only had 1 question about him. but you might get more. i dont know if he will have the same exam or not.

person beta:
hopefully he will use the same exam, cause im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war. it is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class.

person alpha:
if you cant study everything, then that is probably the best way to go.

person beta:
aright. thanks for the info. i gotta go to the library now.

person alpha:
good luck.

person beta:
thanks. see ya.

person alpha:
what's the matter with you, then? you look miserable.

person beta:
it's us.

person alpha:
what do you mean by" us"?

person beta:
well, we used to talk to each other before we were married. remember?

person alpha:
what do you mean? we're talking now, aren't we?

person beta:
oh, yes, but we used to do so much together.

person alpha:
yes. i remember. but we never used to argue. you used to think i was wonderful. where are you going?

person beta:
back to live with my parents. that's something else i used to do before we were married. remember?

person alpha:
hey, blake! are you still listening to mozart?

person beta:
yes.do you like it?

person alpha:
it's great. and i've heard that listening to mozart can make you more intelligent.

person beta:
really? i've never heard that before. i just like it.

person alpha:
is classical music your favorite?

person beta:
yes. what about you?

person alpha:
i like pop music best. classical music is a bit too heavy for me. i can't get fully relaxed in it.

person beta:
pop music doesn't have any depth for me.

person alpha:
yeah, that's why i can enjoy myself in it.

person beta:
did you always like pop music.

person alpha:
i think so, since i was in primary school. how long have you been interested in classical music.

person beta:
i didn't like it at all until i started to learn violin when i was eight. from then on. classical music has been an important part of my life.

person alpha:
oh, i didn't know you can play the violin. do you still play.

person beta:
sometimes, but these days i'm often too busy.

person alpha:
it was really hard for our parents to save money when they were young.

person beta:
most people were living form hand to mouth. how could they?

person alpha:
yeah. they simply had no extra money to save up or for other things.

person beta:
fortunately, things are changing these years.

person alpha:
jane, i was wondering if you you had any plans for saturday afternoon.

person beta:
a friend and i are planing to go out, why? what's up?

person alpha:
there is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum, i was hoping you'd like to come with me.

person beta:
i am afraid i can't i am going to be out all day.

person alpha:
what about sunday?

person beta:
i wish i could, but it's my mums birthday.

person alpha:
maybe next week.

person beta:
much as i'd like to, i am afraid i wont be free next week, i have a lot of work.

person alpha:
sorry to hear that, i was really looking forward to spending some more time with you, i really enjoyed our last chat.

person beta:
i am really sorry too, maybe i can give you a call sometime.

person alpha:
have any plans for the weekend, tom?

person beta:
yeah, i'm going for a hike in the southern rocky mountains.

person alpha:
oh, do you go hiking often?

person beta:
i go as much as i can. i love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature.

person alpha:
it would be nice to get out of the city. do you want some company?

person beta:
sure. but, it will be a long hike, 30 miles in three days. have you been hiking before?

person alpha:
yeah, i go a lot too. i saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike.

person beta:
wow! you must have been pretty far away from the city.

person alpha:
yeah, my friend and i hiked in a very wild part of the national forest.

person beta:
well, bring him along too. we'll have a great time this weekend.

person alpha:
thanks, i'll ask him.

person beta:
how upsetting! he has been away for a week!

person alpha:
i don't know if anything terrible has happened.

person beta:
i have reported it to the police.

person alpha:
we'd better prepare for the worst.

person beta:
you've heard of bruce jenner, haven't you?

person alpha:
he won the decathlon in the 1976 olympics, right?

person beta:
i read that he trained so much that he used to dream about jumping hurdles.

person alpha:
i can think of better things to dream about...

person beta:
sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat, with his legs pumping away.

person alpha:
that's crazy.

person beta:
mike! look at the floor!

person alpha:
what's wrong with it?

person beta:
what's wrong with it? it's filthy!

person alpha:
oh...

person beta:
it's filthy because you never wipe your shoes.

person alpha:
sorry, love.

person beta:
what are you looking for now?

person alpha:
my cigarettes.

person beta:
well, they're not here.they are in the dustbin.

person alpha:
in the dustbin! why didn't you tell me before?

person beta:
excuse me. do you study chinese at this university?

person alpha:
yes, i do. but my characters are very bad.

person beta:
it takes a long time to learn chinese writing.

person alpha:
are you chinese by birth?

person beta:
yes, i am. i am from guangzhou. i am here to study international relations.

person alpha:
how do you like it?

person beta:
i like it so far. but my english still needs work.

person alpha:
i want to study mandarin and public relations.

person beta:
hey, look over there. it seems that there is something interesting going on. let's go and have a look.

person alpha:
sure. it's probably a skiing show. adam told me there are many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors.

person beta:
look at that. it's so dangerous. my mom would never allow me to do that.

person alpha:
stop all this fuss and enjoy the show.

person beta:
you are right. but what if an avalanche happened?

person alpha:
they are all great skiers and very experienced. so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim.

person beta:
anyway, the show is breathtaking. by the way, where did they get so much snow here?

person alpha:
well, they have the most advanced snowmaking machine.

person beta:
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution?

person alpha:
it's possible.

person beta:
you'll never guess what i won at work today!- tickets to tonight's final nba game.

person alpha:
two, i hope and i hope that by telling me about them you are planning on taking me!

person beta:
of course! and here's the best part, they are court side seats!

person alpha:
how in the world! who came up with seats like that from your company?

person beta:
some guy in the accounting department has a brother on the team!

person alpha:
can't beat that! thank you accounting guy!

person beta:
the game starts at seven so we'd better hustle, it's already five.

person alpha:
what are we waiting for? let's go!

person beta:
let's play a game!

person alpha:
ok! how about scrabble?

person beta:
no, no, a friend of mine taught me this really fun game. i'm going to describe someone's face, and you guess who it is!

person alpha:
ok!

person beta:
let's see. he has a roman nose, bushy eyebrows and dimples!

person alpha:
our cousin pete! my turn! she has a pointy nose, sunken eyes and a mole on her chin!

person beta:
aunt rose! that mole is so huge! ok, my turn. he has a crooked nose and full lips. he has quite a few freckles and an oval face. oh, he is also bald!

person alpha:
your future husband!

person beta:
not funny.

person alpha:
as we know, mobile phones bring people great convenience and shorten the distance among friends and relatives.

person beta:
it bears a great many of advantages, but also some weak points.

person alpha:
is it? i've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone.

person beta:
for instance, the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study.

person alpha:
that's true. some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones.

person beta:
actually, it's not the fault of the mobile phone. but people should have a proper attitude towards it. mobile phone is a tool serving people, not the fetters restricting them.

person alpha:
lee, i'm going to get married next month.

person beta:
good news! and congratulations!

person alpha:
you are invited to my wedding.

person beta:
thank you. i'll certainly be there.

person alpha:
thank you for lending me the book.

person beta:
sure. but it's a very difficult one, you need to have a dictionary at your elbow.

person alpha:
but i'm not used to looking up every new word when i'm reading a novel. i only look up the most necessary ones.

person beta:
don't you agree that all the thieves should be punished by cutting off their fingers?

person alpha:
i'm afraid many people would turn thumbs down on it.

person beta:
don't you think in that case, there wouldn't be so much stealing?

person alpha:
definitely. but i think it is too fierce.

person beta:
the bartender just gave the last call. let's order another round, okay?

person alpha:
sure, but let's get a pitcher this time we should be able to down it before they close.

person beta:
that sounds good. you order the beer while i go to the bathroom. where is the can in this place?

person alpha:
it's all the way to the back. see that yellow door?

person beta:
yeah. i think i can find it.

person alpha:
you're back already. that sure was quick.

person beta:
that's because i just took one step inside and turned right around. that bathroom is too gross for me.

person alpha:
well, the bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer. anyway. he said it was too close to closing time.

person beta:
let's leave then. i could take some fresh air, anyway.

person alpha:
okay, let's go!

person beta:
hi, mary! what do you like to do in your spare time?

person alpha:
well, i spend a lot of time watching movies.

person beta:
what a confidence! i always watch a lot of movies, too.

person alpha:
oh really, frank? what kind of movies do you like?

person beta:
actually, i watch whichever movie there is, be it a comedy, a sci-fi or a suspense movie. how about you?

person alpha:
art films are my favorite, but thrillers are cool, too.

person beta:
really impressive. these two genres are totally different.

person alpha:
sure. i enjoy both of them very much.

person beta:
how often do you go to the cinema?

person alpha:
once in a while, i suppose, i usually rent movies at movie salon.

person beta:
movie salon? where is that?

person alpha:
it's a movie rental store in my neighborhood. i've got a membership there.

person beta:
is it good?

person alpha:
yes, you can find almost all new releases there.

person beta:
really? maybe i shall also sign up for its membership.

person alpha:
why not?

person beta:
hey suzie. guess what? i'm having a baby!

person alpha:
really? that's so great. congratulations.

person beta:
thanks. i'm so excited. we've been trying for 8 months now.

person alpha:
that's really exciting. how many months are you pregnant?

person beta:
three months.

person alpha:
are you going to find out if it is a boy or a girl?

person beta:
i want to, but bob doesn't. he wants to be surprised like the old fashioned way.

person alpha:
maybe it's more exciting not knowing.

person beta:
i'd rather know and buy all the baby things ahead of time.

person alpha:
there are so many things you have to prepare for.

person beta:
i know i am going to be busy, but i know i can handle it. i have been looking forward to this day for a long long time.

person alpha:
it really must be an exciting time for you guys.

person beta:
thank you so much.

person alpha:
mary seems depressed. what's the matter?

person beta:
she didn't expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day's hard work.

person alpha:
poor girl!

person beta:
believe it or not, one of the narrowest street in the world is only 49cm wide.

person alpha:
unbelievable! how do people go through it?

person beta:
that's what i'm wondering, too.

person alpha:
i wish i had a chance to see it with my own eyes.

person beta:
would you care to join for the picnic tomorrow?

person alpha:
much to my regret, i'll have to meet my girlfriend at the airport then.

person beta:
we'd like to invite you for our dress party tomorrow evening, are you free?

person alpha:
much as we'd like to, but we've booked up already for that time.

person beta:
what a pity! you can't join us.

person alpha:
so sorry. next time we'll go, thanks anyway.

person beta:
i'd like to invite you to dinner tonight, do you think have time?

person alpha:
thank you for your inition. i'm free tonight.

person beta:
which kind of food do you like, chinese food, western food or sea food?

person alpha:
i prefer sea food.

person beta:
ok. i'll pick up your hotel at 6 thirty pm.

person alpha:
that's fine. i'll be waiting for you.

person beta:
see you later.

person alpha:
bye.

person beta:
look! i bought these shoes only three weeks ago and there is a hole in them already.

person alpha:
if that happen to me, i'll take them back to the shop.

person beta:
i did. but they said they won't change them.

person alpha:
that's terrible. but if they wouldn't change them, i know what i would do.

person beta:
do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work?

person alpha:
of course! it is the no. 1 stressor in my life. you know job stress has become a very common problem these days. so we must learn to cope with it.

person beta:
totally agree. what is your solution?

person alpha:
well, there are two causes of job stress. one is employee characteristic and the other is company condition. so if we want to manage job stress, both we and the companies should do something. for me, i am trying to balance work and leisure time. you know, all work and no play make jack a dull boy.

person beta:
you seem to have a very relaxed outlook.

person alpha:
it is necessary. positive attitude helps to prevent stress.

person beta:
but i don't think we can change our working condition. anyway, we are not the bosses.

person alpha:
i heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them, like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities. our boss is a smart person. he will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team.

person beta:
i am so busy today.

person alpha:
can i help you?

person beta:
i'm not sure. perhaps you could do the shopping.

person alpha:
i'll be glad to help.

person beta:
or maybe make the beds.

person alpha:
all you have to do is ask for help.

person beta:
thanks. that's terrific!

person alpha:
i'm ready and willing to help.

person beta:
the restaurant across the street hired a new chinese chef, so i ordered some chinese food there for this evening.

person alpha:
good. i love chinese food. what did you order?

person beta:
something hot and spicy. they look very inviting on the menu. you are going to love them.

person alpha:
maybe we can find a place to learn some chinese cooking. i hear there's a place in chinatown where you can take some courses. are you interested?

person beta:
i'm not sure. i don't enjoy cooking that much. as long as we can order it from a restaurant, we don't have to learn to do it by ourselves.

person alpha:
you are right. but i just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different.

person beta:
you don't look too well. maybe you should take the day off from work.

person alpha:
i couldn't do that. i have an important meeting to go to today.

person beta:
do you feel ok?

person alpha:
not really. after a 12- hour flight, i've got jetlag, and on top of that, i think i've also got the flu.

person beta:
why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting? you should really get some rest or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now.

person alpha:
could you feel my forehead and check to see if i have a fever?

person beta:
you're really hot. let me get you some tylenol to bring the fever down.

person alpha:
ok. i'll stay home this morning and rest, but if i feel better in the afternoon, i'm going to the meeting.

person beta:
zach, what's that on your arm?

person alpha:
i don't know. it looks a bit red, but i'm sure it's nothing.

person beta:
it looks like you have a red rash all over you! are you allergic to anything?

person alpha:
just cats, but i don't think i was near any cats in the last couple of weeks.

person beta:
i completely forgot about your cat allergy. i took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago. oh no. we'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine. let's go.

person alpha:
shouldn't we make an appointment first?

person beta:
we would, but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse.

person alpha:
whatever you say. i just want to get to my meeting!

person beta:
i can't go to your party.

person alpha:
that's too bad.

person beta:
do you like being a doctor?

person alpha:
yes, most of the time. but, sometimes things can get difficult.

person beta:
can you tell me about it?

person alpha:
you know, sometimes patients can get very unreasonable. they may insist they are sick when they are not.

person beta:
what can you do when this happens?

person alpha:
not much, usually i'll just keep silent.

person beta:
have you eaten?

person alpha:
not yet.

person beta:
it's too hot to read.

person alpha:
we'd better go out for a walk.

person beta:
which season do you like best?

person alpha:
spring.

person beta:
how about summer?

person alpha:
i dislike it most.

person beta:
why?

person alpha:
because the hottest season is summer in a year.

person beta:
but sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons.

person alpha:
my son came home from three years in the navy.

person beta:
it was a real red letter day for you.

person alpha:
yeah. we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home.

person beta:
john, my father isn't there at all. are you kidding?

person alpha:
cool, fellow, what's the date today, buddy?

person beta:
it's... oh it's the 1st april, april fool's day.

person alpha:
you forgot all of about it, didn't you?

person beta:
i must be going.

person alpha:
okay. keep in touch.

person beta:
hi, i made a reservation for a mid-size vehicle. the name is jimmy fox.

person alpha:
i'm sorry, we have no mid-size available at the moment.

person beta:
i don't understand, i made a reservation, do you have my reservation?

person alpha:
yes, we do, unfortunately we ran out of cars.

person beta:
but the reservation keeps the car here. that's why you have the reservation.

person alpha:
i know why we have reservations.

person beta:
i don't think you do.if you did, i'd have a car.see, you know how to take the reservation, you just don't know how to hold the reservation and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. anybody can just take them.

person alpha:
but we do have a compact or an suv if you'd like.

person beta:
fine. i'll take the compact.

person alpha:
alright. we have a blue ford focus for you, mr. fox. would you like insurance?

person beta:
yeah, you better give me the insurance, because i am gonna beat the hell out of this car.

person alpha:
do you think tom will be elected president?

person beta:
no, i think harry will get it.

person alpha:
let's make a bet on who gets it.

person beta:
ok, loser buys pizza tomorrow night.

person alpha:
i met a girl in elevator this morning. she works in a company upstairs. she said she envied the casual way we dress for work. she complained about the dress rule in her company. it requires everyone to wear formal clothes from monday to friday.

person beta:
well, i was wondering where those people with professional attire come from. now, i know the answer.

person alpha:
you know, in a sense, a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in july, and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees. even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule, isn't that strict?

person beta:
to some extent, it is. anyway, whether they like it or not, they do give people a very good impression.

person alpha:
but it is unjust to judge a book by its cover. if they're not happy or comfortable with their clothes, they can be less productive.

person beta:
what happened? why didn't he win?

person alpha:
didn't you hear? he was disqualified.

person beta:
how did that happen? he's so talented! i thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal!

person alpha:
if he didn't have any drug problems, he would have won.

person beta:
what? what kind of drugs was he using?

person alpha:
he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster.

person beta:
i thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs.

person alpha:
they are. the only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards.

person beta:
that's so disappointing. i don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs.

person alpha:
i don't think it's right, but i can understand why they might. imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country!

person beta:
regardless of how much pressure you're under, there's never a good reason to take drugs.

person alpha:
i agree. hopefully with the new regulations, fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs.

person beta:
let's hope so.

person alpha:
cindy, how come nearly all the prime-time tv shows are comedies?

person beta:
that's because americans love sitcoms.

person alpha:
sitcoms?

person beta:
situation comedies. a sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly. sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people. if there is one thing that all the shows have in common, it is teaching wholesome values.

person alpha:
in taiwan, prime-time shows are an hour long and most of them aren't comedies.

person beta:
i think americans would rather laugh than cry or be scared in their free time.

person alpha:
are you interested in history?

person beta:
yes, i am. i enjoyed studying it at school, though i had trouble remembering all the dates, so my teacher never gave me good marks.

person alpha:
i love history, but i've always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened.

person beta:
i wish you had been my history teacher! i might have got better marks!

person alpha:
some people say that history repeats itself.

person beta:
what does that mean? the same events never happen twice, do they?

person alpha:
the idea is that the people and dates change, but the reason why things happen stay the same.

person beta:
i see. i think i'd agree with that statement. people often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again.

person alpha:
you're looking great.

person beta:
you, too.

person alpha:
what's the matter, john? you seemed to be restless today.

person beta:
you see, i've been offered a new job. i can't decide whether to take it or not.

person alpha:
oh, that's easy. if it's better than the one you are doing now, go for it. that's my advice.

person beta:
it isn't that easy. i hate to quit my present job. people around here are very nice and the work itself is challenging.

person alpha:
then what about the salary? would you get more?

person beta:
yes, they say i would get a big sum.

person alpha:
have you discussed it with your wife?

person beta:
yes, she leaves it to me.

person alpha:
as i say it the work is well worth try. after all you can get a higher salary.

person beta:
i have to think about it.

person alpha:
sybil. is that spelt with an i or a y?

person beta:
both actually. s, y, b, i, l.

person alpha:
of course.

person beta:
i see mike farmer has make it into the olympic team. he beat the national record by 0.1 of a second.

person alpha:
that's great. he's the best runner i've seen this season. i'm sure he'll win a medal at the olympics.

person beta:
i think you're right. i think we have a very good athletics team. they should do well in the olympics. how many medals do you think we'll win?

person alpha:
i really don't know. i don't think we'll win many gold medals, but i think we should win several silver and bronze ones.

person beta:
what do you think our chance are in other events.

person alpha:
in the last olympics, we did very well in swimming, cycling and ball sports. i think we'll do well in those same events.

person beta:
we might get a gold medal in the sailing too. our team put in a lot of practice.

person alpha:
i think we can expect to get between 30 to 40 medals in total.

person beta:
you are very optimistic!

person alpha:
helen, did you hear i'm having a party? next saturday in my place.

person beta:
i may have something on that day, but thanks for inviting me.

person alpha:
well, drop by if you can.

person beta:
i will, do you want me to bring anything?

person alpha:
no, just bring yourself. i hope to see you there.

person beta:
it's said that john's broken up.

person alpha:
really? but his wife has always waited on him hand and foot.

person beta:
i hear that john's leading a double wife.

person alpha:
it's very bad of him to cheat on a lady like his wife.

person beta:
let's play chess.

person alpha:
i haven't played chess for a long time.

person beta:
that's all right, i'm a beginner. i've just learnt how to play.

person alpha:
look, there's a chessboard. those two men have already finished playing.

person beta:
you're a very good player

person alpha:
not really, but once i won a prize.

person beta:
so did i. i won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners.

person alpha:
my prize was for the best player in the country. now let's start playing chess seriously.

person beta:
you have been here for how long? four months now?

person alpha:
yeah, about.

person beta:
do you know chinese better now?

person alpha:
oh, definitely. i remember, when i first arrived in guangzhou, my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone.

person beta:
oh, yeah. many chinese like to bargain. it happens almost everywhere.

person alpha:
i mean, i understand that. but the speed of the conversation got faster and faster, until it seemed to me that they would fight. my perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match. the truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation.

person beta:
a shouting match? you're so funny. you must be exaggerating. i don't believe it.

person alpha:
i am not exaggerating at all. i'm telling you the truth. that was how i felt at that time.

person beta:
yes, perhaps. chinese usually don't notice that sort of thing. maybe it's quite natural to us.

person alpha:
yes, absolutely true.

person beta:
excuse me, can you tell me the name of the book you read?

person alpha:
harry potter.

person beta:
harry potter? is that book funny?

person alpha:
actually, the language itself is not so funny, but you can imagine the scene, that's funny.

person beta:
got it.

person alpha:
have you ever read this book before?

person beta:
no, but my little brother likes it very much.

person alpha:
it's really a good book. you will like it too.

person beta:
i'll try to read it. actually, i like literature very much.

person alpha:
wow, that sounds like a scholar. by the way, who's your favorite writer?

person beta:
jane austen.

person alpha:
me too. pride and prejudice is my favorite.

person beta:
i like it too. but sense and sensibility is my favorite.

person alpha:
oh, it's getting late. i've got to run. it was nice talking to you, karren.

person beta:
thanks, tim.nice meeting you, too.

person alpha:
i guess we'll see just around.

person beta:
ye, i hope so.well.take it easy.

person alpha:
you too.

person beta:
hey sandra, what's wrong? you look furious!

person alpha:
i've had it with tim! i think i'm going to quit!

person beta:
but sandra... you love your job! you spent months trying to get this position. it's perfect for you!

person alpha:
yeah... i know. but i'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles!

person beta:
what kind of power struggles are you talking about?

person alpha:
basically, i think tim is threatened by me. i'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career!

person beta:
so he talks about you behind your back?

person alpha:
yes. he's all nice and friendly to my face. but the second i turn around he stabs me in the back!

person beta:
i had a worker like that once. she was always taking credit for my ideas.

person alpha:
i should keep a better record of my correspondence with the clients so if necessary i can prove it was my effort.

person beta:
my co-worker had a whole bunch of bad office habits. she liked to name-drop... we would be in a meeting and she would say, yesterday i was chatting with tom. she meant tom solomon... our ceo.

person alpha:
doris, i'm glad you're home. i'm terrified. i don't know what to do!

person beta:
what is it? what happened?

person alpha:
i think someone is stalking me.

person beta:
no, it can't be. really? who?

person alpha:
i don't know. i saw him the first time tuesday. he was at the cafe. i noticed he was looking at me a lot. not just the usual looking, but staring.he just kept staring at me. he didn't stop.

person beta:
what did you do?

person alpha:
i didn't do anything. finally, he left.but then i saw him again today. outside the shoe store. near the cafe. i went into a cd store and pretended i was looking at cd's. but then he came in too.

person beta:
did he leave when you left?

person alpha:
yes. then i noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me. he was following me.

person beta:
what did you do?

person alpha:
man, i'm hungry. do you know a good place to have lunch?

person beta:
yes, i know a great place. what types of food do you like?

person alpha:
mexican, japanese or chinese would be great.

person beta:
oh, i know a place where you might like to eat.

person alpha:
is it close by?

person beta:
it's down a block on the right; can i show you the way?

person alpha:
ok, i'd love the company.

person beta:
this will work out well. i'm getting hungry just thinking about it.

person alpha:
have you ever been to disneyworld?

person beta:
when i was young, my parents took me to the one in california. i always forget which-- is that one disneyland or disneyworld?

person alpha:
the one in florida is disneyworld and the one in california is disneyland, so you must have been to disneyland.

person beta:
that's right. why do you ask?

person alpha:
well, i've never been to either so i was thinking of going to disneyworld for my honeymoon.

person beta:
when are you getting married?

person alpha:
some time next year. we haven't set the date yet.

person beta:
congratulations! i had no idea.

person alpha:
thank you. so what do you think? would we have a good time?

person beta:
do you like amusement parks?

person alpha:
for the most part, yes. some of the rides are bit too scary for me, though.

person beta:
if you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can, you'll have a good time.

person alpha:
even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark?

person beta:
even those. it'll be very romantic, i think. you'll have loads of fun.

person alpha:
thanks for the advice. i'll talk to my fiance about it tonight.

person beta:
i'm sure he'll love the idea. just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it!

person alpha:
matthew? hi!

person beta:
steve! haven't seen you in ages! how long's it been?

person alpha:
it's got to be almost a year now.

person beta:
how have you been?

person alpha:
i'm pretty good. i've been looking for a place to live recently. my lease runs out next month and i don't want to renew it.

person beta:
yeah, i remember the neighborhood. have you found a place yet?

person alpha:
not yet. but i am still looking through the classifieds. wish me luck.

person beta:
well, maybe i can help. remember my neighbor?

person alpha:
mrs. thou?

person beta:
yes, her daughter's having a baby, so she's moving in with her to help out. i think if you are interested, you can come over and have a look.

person alpha:
great. it's a lovely neighborhood. and it would be nice to be neighbors again. it would be just like the old days!

person beta:
i'll ask mrs. thou when she's available to show the apartment and let you know. has your number changed?

person alpha:
are you ready to go to the mall?

person beta:
yeah. dig my new pants?

person alpha:
copycat!

person beta:
what do you mean?

person alpha:
you went out and bought khakis, too!

person beta:
no. mine are a soft brown. yours are khaki.

person alpha:
whatever.

person beta:
have heard of paul?

person alpha:
no, what?

person beta:
he's got a promotion.

person alpha:
you're kidding.

person beta:
no, they made him vicepresident in charge of sells.

person alpha:
i don't believe it.he is only being with the company for two years.

person beta:
well, it's true.the board man last thirdly and they choice paul.

person alpha:
well.good for him.

person beta:
jeff, i'm going to the supermarket. do you want to come with me?

person alpha:
i think the supermarket is closed now.

person beta:
oh, when does it close?

person alpha:
it closes at 7:00 on sundays.

person beta:
that's too bad.

person alpha:
don't worry, we can go tomorrow morning. it opens at 8: 00.

person beta:
alright. what do you want to do now?

person alpha:
let's take a walk for a half an hour. my sister will get here at about 8: 30pm and then we can all go out to dinner.

person beta:
where does she live?

person alpha:
she lives in san francisco.

person beta:
how long has she lived there?

person alpha:
i think she's lived there for about 10 years.

person beta:
that's a long time. where did she live before that?

person alpha:
san diego.

person beta:
hey, peter, have you had lunch yet?

person alpha:
no. how about you?

person beta:
not yet. let's go to that restaurant on the corner.

person alpha:
who's that?

person beta:
search me.

person alpha:
i had a big argument with david yesterday. i hope he's not still mad at me.

person beta:
what did you argue about?

person alpha:
he borrowed some money from me and i needed it back. he said he didn't have the money yet.

person beta:
well, he should pay you back. it's only fair.

person alpha:
yes, but i got angry with him too quickly. he probably thought that i mistrusted him. i shouldn't have got angry.

person beta:
did you lend him a lot of money?

person alpha:
not much. i had to pay an unexpected bill, so i needed the money back.

person beta:
well, talk to him about it next time you see him. he probably feels as bad about it as you do. close friends sometimes have disagreements. it's nothing unusual. neither of you said anything really nasty, did you?

person alpha:
no, we didn't. i guess you're right. we should patch things up.

person beta:
of course you should. you wouldn't want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship, would you?

person alpha:
did you read the letter in the paper about smoking? the person who wrote that must be crazy.

person beta:
i don't think so. i think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking.

person alpha:
maybe so. but a law banning cigarettes will do no good.

person beta:
no, you can't suddenly make smoking illegal, but government could prohibit smoking in public places like movies and theatres.

person alpha:
do you know that the dolphin is the most intelligent animal in the world?

person beta:
yes. dolphins have a big brain and they are very smart. they are also the fastest swimmers in the world.

person alpha:
they must be amazing animals.

person beta:
they are. i read a story about a dolphin saving a a from drowning in the sea.

person alpha:
i read that story too. they seem to be able to understand men.

person beta:
they sure can. maybe they can interact with men better than monkeys and apes.

person alpha:
oh dear, my weight has gone up again.

person beta:
i am not surprised, you eat too much.

person alpha:
and i suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office doesn't help.

person beta:
no, i wouldn't think so.

person alpha:
i do wish i could lose weight.

person beta:
well, why don't you go on the diet?

person alpha:
i've tried diets before but they've never worked.

person beta:
perhaps you should excercise more. why don't you go to an exercise class.

person alpha:
yes, maybe i should.

person beta:
could you please wait for a minute? i'll buy the tickets

person alpha:
all right.

person beta:
here is your ticket.

person alpha:
thank you.

person beta:
the park will close soon. we should better go in right now.

person alpha:
really?

person beta:
yes, let's go in.

person alpha:
it is a new park, isn't it?

person beta:
yes, how do you know?

person alpha:
i guessed it.

person beta:
well, generally speaking, the park is a window on the world history, a window on the world civilization and a window on the world's tourist attractions as well.

person alpha:
oh, how wonderful!

person beta:
i was just watching a documentary on tv about how people use dogs for various purpose. it was very interesting.

person alpha:
i love dogs. they have been used as guards for centuries. nowadays, they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers.

person beta:
the documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow.

person alpha:
horses are useful to people too. we use them for sports and recreation.

person beta:
don't forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts.

person alpha:
can you ride a horse?

person beta:
yes, i can. i don't ride regularly though. how about you?

person alpha:
i can ride too. perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend?

person beta:
what a good idea!

person alpha:
where's mrs. johnson?

person beta:
just call her lisa, mary. she's cooking dinner.

person alpha:
i see. can i sit down?

person beta:
of course! make yourself at home.

person alpha:
thank you, mr. johnson.

person beta:
please, just call me tom.

person alpha:
okay, tom.

person beta:
where's cindy?

person alpha:
she's upstairs in my room.

person beta:
can you tell her to come downstairs? we're about to have dinner.

person alpha:
have you heard of paul?

person beta:
no, what?

person alpha:
he's got a promotion.

person beta:
you're kidding.

person alpha:
no, they made him vicepresident in charge of sells.

person beta:
oh, i don't believe it. he is only being with the company for two years.

person alpha:
well, it's true. the board man last thirdly and they choice paul.

person beta:
well. good for him.

person alpha:
let's speed up. we're going to be late again.

person beta:
if we hurry, can we get there in time?

person alpha:
i hope so.

person beta:
is it your first time to join the sports meeting of junior high school?

person alpha:
yes, and it's great. what are the events at the sports meeting?

person beta:
long-distance race, dash, hurdle race, relay race, standing long jump, high jump, shotput and so on.

person alpha:
our neighbor, bruce, will take part in the relay race. let's go have a look.

person beta:
ok, let's go.

person alpha:
the competition will begin in 5 minutes, it's tense here.

person beta:
wonderful, bruce is taking the lead.

person alpha:
other competitors have almost caught up with him. they are neck and neck.

person beta:
come on, bruce. come on, bruce.

person alpha:
wow, bruce crossed the line first.

person beta:
tim's smiles are interesting.

person alpha:
yes, they are shy and gentle but very powerful.

person beta:
you are right. they sweep nancy off her feet. and now she fell head over heels in love with him.

person alpha:
how wonderful it would be if i had such smiles!

person beta:
have you enjoyed your weekend?

person alpha:
yes, it's been marvelous. it really was very kind of you to invite me. i hope it hasn't been too much trouble.

person beta:
not at all. we've really enjoyed having you. i hope you'll come and stay again next time you're in changsha.

person alpha:
the great wall is a great attraction for visitors.

person beta:
it's a man-made wonder. i've seen it many times in textbooks and it's part of my dream to visit it.

person alpha:
someone claimed it was one of the two man-made wonders that could be seen on the moon.

person beta:
that's true.

person alpha:
i'm forming a music band.

person beta:
do you already know how to play an instrument?

person alpha:
uh... yeah! i've told you a thousand times that i'm learning to play the drums. now that i know how to play well, i would like to form a rock band.

person beta:
aside from yourself, who are the other members of the band?

person alpha:
we have a guy who plays guitar, and another who plays bass. although we still haven't found anyone to be our singer. you told me that you had some musical talent, right?

person beta:
yes, i'm a singer.

person alpha:
perfect. so you can audition this weekend here at my house.

person beta:
great! wait here? you don't have enough room for the amplifiers, microphones or even your drums! by the way where do you keep them or practice?

person alpha:
what would you like for christmas?

person beta:
i would like to have that new style gl joe.

person alpha:
have you asked santa?

person beta:
yes and i've written him a letter.

person alpha:
lili, let's take a vacation!

person beta:
george, how can we? vacations cost money. and this month we don't have much money left after paying the rent.

person alpha:
well, lili, we can visit different places in the state in our van 10. we are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time. trust me, it won't cost much.

person beta:
where will we sleep, then?

person alpha:
in the van.

person beta:
what about other expenses?

person alpha:
let's see. gas, food, recreation, we won't spend much. come on. don't hesitate. we need to get out of the house once in a while. we have been working hard, haven't we?

person beta:
maybe you're right. when do you plan to go?

person alpha:
the sooner the better! i can't wait!

person beta:
oh, i don't know where we're going yet.

person alpha:
as long as we're going, you can decide where to go. i trust your judgments. i know you miss chinese food, so we can eat at a chinese restaurant this time.

person beta:
let's go to chicago.we can have lunch in chinatown.then we can go to a ball game at wrigley field!

person alpha:
you have such good ideas!

person beta:
what date will our field trip be on?

person alpha:
the science field trip is next monday at 8 o'clock in the morning. do you want to make note of that on your calendar?

person beta:
yes, i will make note of that.

person alpha:
next monday is december 2nd. the buses will leave at 8, but we must begin loading at 7

person beta:
i will be there half an hour early.

person alpha:
you might want to tell whoever is picking you up that you will return on december 8th. do you have a ride?

person beta:
yes, someone is picking me up.

person alpha:
to get back to campus by 8

person beta:
not at the moment-- maybe later, though.

person alpha:
all of the extra information that you need is on the bulletin board in the hallway. see you on monday!

person beta:
the acting of this film is marvelous in spite of the thin plot.

person alpha:
i'm sorry for hero.

person beta:
i don't think there's any excuse for his acting in some parts.

person alpha:
don't be too critical. we can't expect it to be perfect.

person beta:
how was your business trip?

person alpha:
great- they wined and dined us all week.

person beta:
nice to meet you here.how come you dropped into this company today?

person alpha:
my boss sent me here to take some business documents back to his office. i didn't know you were working here.what a surprise.how long have you been doing this?

person beta:
two years or so.

person alpha:
that is great.do you have to work the night shift?

person beta:
no, in most cases i don't have to unless there is something urgent to deal with. i work five days a week.

person alpha:
do you enjoy work here?

person beta:
it is hard to say.but i've to start by working as a trainee before i really become an experienced marketing assistant.sometimes, i am really under great pressure when it gets busy.

person alpha:
take it easy. i'm sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant. i hope you haven't been given much trouble in the job.

person beta:
luckily not.the silent i meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss.

person alpha:
glad to hear that.

person beta:
scientists have found a second solar system in the universe.

person alpha:
what's the second solar system?

person beta:
it's just a system like ours, with a star and a number of planets going around it.

person alpha:
is this good news or bad news?

person beta:
it's exciting news! if we find a second solar system, we might find a second earth!

person alpha:
you mean with people on it?

person beta:
yes! isn't that exciting?

person alpha:
why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend?

person beta:
sorry, i thought you knew.

person alpha:
but you should tell me you were in love with her.

person beta:
didn't i?

person alpha:
you know you didn't.

person beta:
well, i am telling you now.

person alpha:
yes, but you might have told me before.

person beta:
i didn't think you would be interested.

person alpha:
you can't be serious. how dare you not tell me you are going to marry her?

person beta:
sorry, i didn't think it mattered.

person alpha:
oh, you men! you are all the same.

person beta:
how was the movie last night?

person alpha:
i didn't really like it.

person beta:
mary said that she was really pleased with the photography.

person alpha:
i found it very disappointing.

person beta:
she liked the acting, too, because that's what she wanted to see.

person alpha:
i wasn't happy with it.

person beta:
nothing is to your satisfaction.

person alpha:
honey, i'll be right back!

person beta:
where are you going?

person alpha:
i told you already! i'm going to get my nails done.

person beta:
again? you just went last week! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home! honestly, why do you need a manicure every week?

person alpha:
well, first of all, i like to pamper myself, and my nails look great. you should come with me!

person beta:
why? i don't want to have nail polish or anything like that!

person alpha:
they don't only paint my nails! the manicurist will remove my cuticles, file my nails, and apply at least nails coats of nail polish!

person beta:
yeah, sounds like something i should definitely do.

person alpha:
good afternoon!

person beta:
good afternoon! sit down, please.how are you?

person alpha:
i'm very well, thank you.how are you?

person beta:
very well too, thank you very much.isn't it a lovely day?

person alpha:
yes, it's beautiful, but it's also very hot.

person beta:
yes.

person alpha:
what's the weather like in your country?

person beta:
mm... it's quite warm now.

person alpha:
where do you live?

person beta:
in london.where do you live?

person alpha:
here.near this school.

person beta:
i've had it! i'm done working for a company that is taking me nowhere!

person alpha:
so what are you gonna do? just quit?

person beta:
that's exactly what i am going to do! i've decided to create my own company! i'm going to write up a business plan, get some investors and start working for myself!

person alpha:
have you ever written up a business plan before?

person beta:
well, no, it can't be that hard! i mean, all you have to do is explain your business, how you are going to do things and that's it, right?

person alpha:
you couldn't be more wrong! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less. then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has, history, etc.

person beta:
well, that seems easy enough.

person alpha:
wait, there's more! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services. what they are and how they are different from competitors'? then comes the hard part, a market analysis. you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per capita to how many children on average the population has! all this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage, where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea.

person beta:
geez. is that all?

person alpha:
almost, the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis. here you will calculate and estimate sales, cash flow and profits. after all, people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment!

person beta:
umm. i think i'll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business!

person alpha:
i hear that mary got mad.

person beta:
so i heard.

person alpha:
what's wrong with her?

person beta:
she went over the edge after her son was killed in an accident.

person alpha:
um, what will you do this weekend?

person beta:
how about a movie? we haven't done that for a while.

person alpha:
a movie? sure. do you know what's on right now?

person beta:
no. why don't you check out the newspaper?

person alpha:
ok. maybe you should invite your sister along, too.

person beta:
what's on tv tonight?

person alpha:
not much, that new reality-tv show, ally mcneal, oooo, dark angel.

person beta:
wait a second. i want to watch ally mcneal.

person alpha:
oh, come on. that's such a girl's show.

person beta:
no it's not. it's just funny.

person alpha:
yeah, if you're a girl.

person beta:
well, you just want to watch dark angel because of the hot girl.

person alpha:
that's not true. dark angel is a good show.

person beta:
it's story is just an excuse to get the girl dressed up in different tight outfits.

person alpha:
o. k., o. k. let's forget it. there's a football game on too.

person beta:
no way. i'm watching ally mcneal. go to john's to watch the game.

person alpha:
it's really terrible!

person beta:
what are you talking about?

person alpha:
don't you see many parents are forcing there children's hands to learn something they think important to their children. but the children are not interested in it at all.

person beta:
you said it. many parents just don't know how to educate their children.

person alpha:
sarah, what did you do today?

person beta:
i went shopping.

person alpha:
did you buy anything?

person beta:
yes, i bought a few things.

person alpha:
what did you buy?

person beta:
i bought this coat. do you like it?

person alpha:
yeah, i like it a lot. it's very pretty. where did you buy it?

person beta:
at the mall on 5th street.

person alpha:
was it expensive?

person beta:
no, it wasn't expensive. it was on sale for 20 dollars.

person alpha:
that's cheap.

person beta:
i know. it was a really good deal.

person alpha:
i don't think you'll need to wear it for a while. it's been really hot lately.

person beta:
hi, victor. how are you?

person alpha:
oh, i'm fine.

person beta:
so, are you going to go to class tonight?

person alpha:
maybe... but i don't think so.

person beta:
really? what's the matter?

person alpha:
i don't know. i'm just feeling a little sad.

person beta:
listen. come with me to class, and after class we can go out for dinner.

person alpha:
now that's a good idea. thanks a lot, brian. i'm feeling better already.

person beta:
how's john doing?

person alpha:
he can barely make ends meet.

person beta:
the phoenix team overpowered its counterpart 86 to 50.

person alpha:
they're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21.

person beta:
if the phoenix beats the rocket, it will enter the final.

person alpha:
no way, if it still has 21.

person beta:
what's that book you have under your arm?

person alpha:
it's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months.

person beta:
how in the world did you get a copy? i've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and i'm still waiting my turn.

person alpha:
i checked it out of the rental library. it only costs five cents a day.

person beta:
is it really worth paying for?

person alpha:
i can't tell yet. i haven't got beyond the first chapter.

person beta:
if it's any good, i'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition.

person alpha:
come on, you are left behind!

person beta:
wow, i can't catch my breath. you are running too fast, honey.

person alpha:
you just need more exercise.

person beta:
yes, but you need to slow down. this is jogging, not racing!

person alpha:
i don't care. i want to burn up my fat.

person beta:
but running so fast is not good for people over forties.

person alpha:
why?

person beta:
we are not as athletic as we were when young. mild exercise is more suitable for us.

person alpha:
but i want to burn up more calories!

person beta:
in fact, in order to burn up your fat, you must take it slowly for a longer time.

person alpha:
really? i will slow down then.

person beta:
hello, daisy, how are you doing?

person alpha:
fine, thank you. i haven't seen you for quite some time. what have you been up to recently?

person beta:
i have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home, so you wouldn't have seen me. recently, i've been obsessed with horror films.

person alpha:
oh, how can you be infatuated with horror films? they're so scary.

person beta:
yeah, you are right i used to not watch horror films, but after seeing silence of the lamb with mike last month, i fell in love with them.

person alpha:
it's amazing. but if i were you, i wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one.

person beta:
but it's really exciting.

person alpha:
maybe, but i would rather watch romance, science fiction, crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture. i wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one.

person beta:
basically. you'll watch any type of movie except horror.

person alpha:
yep.

person beta:
i think you should have a try someday. maybe you'll change your mind.

person alpha:
maybe. after all, i am grown up now.

person beta:
it's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed... the trade deficit is getting larger, consumption's down, i really think we're headed for a recession.

person alpha:
the economy has been stagnant for a while now. we've been in a recessive state for several months already. what worries me the most is the trade deficit. i think the government should do more to encourage exports.

person beta:
increasing exports would weaken the currency. i think the main point is economic growth. we need more jobs. factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries. the result is an increase in unemployment in our own country, lower consumption, lower production, and an overall feeble economy. if more people are working, it will give the economy a boost.

person alpha:
it's true that we should do something about unemployment, but what about inflation? if unemployment falls, there's pressure to increase pay. that would result in inflation, which would result in a much less dynamic economy.

person beta:
are you an art aficionado?

person alpha:
not really. i like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year. i hardly know anything about art or sculpture. you are a true art lover, aren't you?

person beta:
i love going to art galleries, particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art.

person alpha:
i never understand the meaning of those painting. they are too abstract for me. i didn't pay much attention in art class at school.

person beta:
art isn't for everyone. i'm going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery. it's an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture.

person alpha:
i like sculpture, especially that from ancient rome or greece. what time are you thinking of going? i'd love to go with you.

person beta:
i thought i'd have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards. does that sound ok to you? bus 51 goes directly there.

person alpha:
that sounds fine. what time shall we meet at the bus stop?

person beta:
let's meet at 12 thirty. it will probably take us three or four hours to see all of the exhibits.

person alpha:
what does your mother do, may i ask?

person beta:
my mother works in a company as an accountant.

person alpha:
is she busy?

person beta:
not always, she's rather busy at the end of the year.

person alpha:
hello, bessie.

person beta:
hello, jack.happy birthday!

person alpha:
my birthday? i forgot it, thank you for remembering my birthday.

person beta:
i'd like to offer you my congratulations on your birthday and best wishes for your future happiness, good health and continued success. i've asked the fairy flowers to send you a bunch of flowers. i hope you'll like them.

person alpha:
thanks a lot. i'm so touched.

person beta:
now let me sing" happy birthday" for you.

person alpha:
thank you very much.

person beta:
nice day, isn't it?

person alpha:
it sure is.

person beta:
it's a good day for a picnic.

person alpha:
why don't you sit down and relax, darling?

person beta:
i don't want to.

person alpha:
well, come over and talk to me then.

person beta:
certainly not.

person alpha:
may i turn on the tv then?

person beta:
turn on the tv for what?

person alpha:
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music.

person beta:
listen to the music? and who will cook dinner, will you?

person alpha:
i will, but let's go to the disco after dinner.

person beta:
to a disco? oh, no. you know i hate it.

person alpha:
diane grant? i haven't seen you for ages!

person beta:
brian! how have you been?

person alpha:
pretty good. say, you've really changed!

person beta:
oh, well, i've lost some weight. and my hair is longer than before.

person alpha:
well, you look great! how are you?

person beta:
i'm doing really well. i got married about three years ago. i have two kids now.

person alpha:
that's terrific!

person beta:
how is your new dormitory?

person alpha:
it's very nice. there are only four people, and those girls are very kind and friendly.

person beta:
well, do you all major in the same subject?

person alpha:
no, the other three girls major in a computer science, and they can help me a lot with the computer operating.

person beta:
that's great!

person alpha:
peter, how often do you exercise?

person beta:
well, i swim and run every day.

person alpha:
now, tell me, what do you eat?

person beta:
well, i don't eat any meat, but i do eat fish and eggs.

person alpha:
do you eat a lot of vegetables?

person beta:
oh yes, and fruit, i love fruit.

person alpha:
what do you drink?

person beta:
well, i never drink alcohol, coffee or tea. they are very bad for you.

person alpha:
what's the mountaineering club doing this weekend?

person beta:
we are going to climb a cliff on the colorado river.

person alpha:
how hard is the climb?

person beta:
it is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet.

person alpha:
what did you do last week?

person beta:
we rappelled down the side of 300- foot cliff. it was very exciting.

person alpha:
wow! that sounds like a lot of fun. i'm sorry i missed it.

person beta:
well, you should come this weekend. i think you could do the climb.

person alpha:
yeah, i will. see you then!

person beta:
o. k. see you.

person alpha:
how many languages can you speak?

person beta:
i can speak french and german.

person alpha:
how well can you speak them?

person beta:
i can speak german quite well, but i can't speak french very well.

person alpha:
can you help me to translate these sentences into german now?

person beta:
no, but i'll be able to tomorrow.

person alpha:
gross! what are you doing to yourself?

person beta:
chill! i'm just curling my eyelashes.

person alpha:
it looks like some kind of primitive form of torture.

person beta:
you're such a wimp! you're afraid of an eyelash curler.

person alpha:
well, you might pinch your eyelid! or lose an eyeball!

person beta:
it just makes my eyelashes curl upwards.

person alpha:
do you really have to work today?

person beta:
yes. i'm afraid so.

person alpha:
but you'll miss out on the football game.

person beta:
oh. well, it can't be helped.

person alpha:
how smart of you to book the tickets before hand!

person beta:
oh, do you really think so?

person alpha:
of course, otherwise you'll just have to wait for hours.

person beta:
but i just got a call from my sister and i have to cancel the movie tonight.

person alpha:
i had an accident.

person beta:
that's terrible!

person alpha:
i found a new job after all, and i like this one even better than the last.

person beta:
you see? every cloud has a silver lining.

person alpha:
tom, i won first prize in the poetry contest.

person beta:
come on! you're pulling my leg.

person alpha:
really! here's my trophy.

person beta:
wow! congratulations!

person alpha:
what a beautiful watch. it goes very well with your ring.

person beta:
thank you.

person alpha:
is that your wedding ring?

person beta:
i'm not married yet. it's my engagement ring.

person alpha:
well, congratulations. when is the big date?

person beta:
in june.

person alpha:
did you have the watch before getting the ring?

person beta:
actually, we bought the ring together after i got the watch.

person alpha:
you did a fabulous job with the selection. it's gorgeous.

person beta:
thank you so much.

person alpha:
what kind of watch is it?

person beta:
it's a tag heer.

person alpha:
if you don't mind me asking, how much do they cost?

person beta:
this one is$ 1500. but they range from$ 600 to$ 3000.

person alpha:
that's why it looks so nice. i should have figured. you always get what you pay for.

person beta:
yeah. i would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones.

person alpha:
i'm really mad at bob.

person beta:
what for?( why?)

person alpha:
hi, jack, how have you been?

person beta:
not very well.

person alpha:
why? looks like you're feeling very down! what happened?

person beta:
nothing.

person alpha:
come on. for a man who's feeling so, down, there're usually two reasons. either his career is going downhill, or he has a broken heart. since you're so successful, it must be the latter.

person beta:
well, you're right. i just broke up with jane.

person alpha:
oh, i'm sorry. i thought you two were made for each ocher.

person beta:
well, you never know. i'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down, but she says she wants to pursue her career while she's still young.

person alpha:
well, she is not to blame. it's always difficult to choose between career and family.

person beta:
maybe you're right.

person alpha:
jack, i don't know what to say to comfort you, but cheer up! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you'll find your soul mate, your perfect match!

person beta:
yeah, but it's hard to forget her at moment. you know, we were together for almost five years. it's really hard...

person alpha:
do you know sally?

person beta:
sally. she is a bachelor girl. she is an excellent designer. many of the company's advertisements are her child trains.

person alpha:
why is she still single? she must have a face that would stop clock.

person beta:
oh, quite the other way round. she is a knock-out. she devotes much of her time to her career.

person alpha:
excuse me. do you have the time?

person beta:
my watch is a few minutes fast. it's about six forty, i think.

person alpha:
is it? oh, no. the concert will begin in twenty minutes. are we too late to get there?

person beta:
if we start now, we can make it by taxi.

person alpha:
did you watch the volleyball match last night?

person beta:
yeah.

person alpha:
who won?

person beta:
china.

person alpha:
what is the score?

person beta:
china beat brazil three to zero.

person alpha:
wonderful.

person beta:
what do you mean? if he was a good programmer, he should have been raking it in.

person alpha:
the boss wanted to pay bob with stock options. but bob didn't want to play that game again.

person beta:
again?

person alpha:
at his last start-up, bob worked for stock and no salary. they folded and he made zip.

person beta:
ouch.

person alpha:
now he only works freelance. hundred bucks an hour.

person beta:
you mustn't touch the wet paint, bill.

person alpha:
i'm sorry. i won't do it again.

person beta:
try to be more careful in future. look! you've damaged the sign.

person alpha:
is this the sign? what does it says?

person beta:
it says no smoking here.

person alpha:
good morning. i'm from the new york book review. could i ask you some questions about your latest book?

person beta:
sure. take a seat... what would you like to know?

person alpha:
first, i've heard that your latest book is based on a true story.

person beta:
that's correct. it's a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in florida several years ago. the main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case.

person alpha:
how do you research your books?

person beta:
i always visit the places that i use as setting for stories. readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction! i usually base my characters on people i have met. most character are a mixture of the characters of two or more people.

person alpha:
i really like your books. i've just finished this one. i read it from cover to cover in a single day. congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again!

person beta:
thank you. let met sign it for you... there you go.

person alpha:
oh! thank you very much. i heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories. what are the stories about?

person beta:
there's a real mix of stories in the book. i haven't finished all of them yet, though. many of them are short detective stories, but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones. if you give me your business card, i'll make sure you get an advance copy to review.

person alpha:
thanks very much. i'm sure it will sell well. i can't wait to read it. here's my card. thank you for you time.

person beta:
what shall i call him?

person alpha:
oh, you may call him uncle, or henry.

person beta:
what's he doing?

person alpha:
he's checking bags.he's an official in the customs.

person beta:
for the 100th anniversary of the opening of the library we are going to have a party.

person alpha:
that's a wonderful way to celebrate this grand old library!

person beta:
i hoped you would be willing to brainstorm with me for party ideas.

person alpha:
that is right up my alley. you say party and i'm there.

person beta:
perfect. it will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about five to seven hundred people.

person alpha:
will it be an all day event?

person beta:
yes. and we checked with the city and we have permission to use the park adjacent to the library.

person alpha:
that was quick thinking.

person beta:
i'm so glad i bought this watch!

person alpha:
cool! flashy red lines!

person beta:
i think this is the coolest watch i've ever owned.

person alpha:
is it waterproof?

person beta:
isn't that a silly question? you know how much of an athlete i am.

person alpha:
uh, huh... so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for?

person beta:
well, surfing, scuba diving...

person alpha:
do you take a bus to and from work?

person beta:
yeah, everyday. and there's only one choice. all the other buses are going the other direction.

person alpha:
hmm. i have the same problem. when i leave work, it's always rush hour. so the buses are always crowded.

person beta:
oh, yeah, it's terrible. i will tell you the funniest thing i have seen in china. it's when so many people try to get onto one city bus, and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt.

person alpha:
that sounds terrible the way you describe it. but you know, not long ago i really suffered on the bus.

person beta:
what happened? were you having a hard time getting on a bus?

person alpha:
you just can't imagine! i waited for the first bus but it was too full, so i waited for the second, and it was still very crowded. then i decided not to wait for the next one, and got on the second bus. it was so full that i had to stand on one foot! no kidding!

person beta:
hmm. good exercise, uh?

person alpha:
yeah, absolutely!

person beta:
and it's so much fun. one day, the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl's behind was pressed against my front. i was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her.

person alpha:
you were so happy, weren't you?

person beta:
what do you think? i'm a good boy.

person alpha:
we are going to have a picnic tomorrow at the picnic center.

person beta:
that's great.

person alpha:
now let's get things ready.

person beta:
don't worry. there are all kinds of things in the center.

person alpha:
that's much more convenient. we don't even have to bring the flavorings.

person beta:
look! mom, that's amazing! i can't believe the girls have so neat movements.

person alpha:
yeah, they all received very strict training. a minute on the stage takes ten-year practice.

person beta:
and all their movements are so elegant. it seems like dancing in the water.

person alpha:
exactly, you know, water ballet puts dancing, music and swimming together.

person beta:
there you go! daddy has told me that water ballet is also called synchronized swimming.

person alpha:
that's my boy! katherine curtis created this activity in 1920. and in 1984, it was authorized as one activity in olympic games.

person beta:
wow, mom is more knowledgeable than dad. i must learn from you.

person alpha:
my little boy, you should learn more from me. i'm almost thirty years older than you.

person beta:
ok, you're the boss. look, mom, one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool.

person alpha:
oh, my god. it's so dangerous. and he might break his leg. you mustn't do anything like that.

person beta:
it seems that nobody in your class likes paul.

person alpha:
the boy is good for nothing.

person beta:
as a teacher, i don't know how to help him.

person alpha:
he is hopeless.

person beta:
hey rachael, what's up? how is your day?

person alpha:
not bad.we have had a big meeting today, remember?

person beta:
oh, yea. i forgot.so how did it go?

person alpha:
pretty well. i think the boss liked my ideas.

person beta:
great, so what happens now?

person alpha:
well, i have to write the proposal. i'm pretty excited about it.

person beta:
do you believe in ufos?

person alpha:
of course, they are out there.

person beta:
but i never saw them.

person alpha:
are you stupid? they are called ufos, so not everybody can see them.

person beta:
you mean that you can them.

person alpha:
that's right. i can see them in my dreams.

person beta:
they come to the earth?

person alpha:
no. their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space.

person beta:
aliens from the outer space? do you talk to them? what do they look like?

person alpha:
ok, ok, one by one, please! they look like robots, but they can speak. their mission is to make friends with human beings.

person beta:
that means that you talk to them? in which language?

person alpha:
of course in english, they learn english on mars too.

person beta:
wow. sounds fantastic!

person alpha:
you look so happy, anna. any good news?

person beta:
yes. i've won the first prize in the math contest.

person alpha:
really? congratulations!

person beta:
thank you, paul.

person alpha:
by the way, would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening? tomorrow is my birthday.

person beta:
good, happy birthday to you!

person alpha:
not so soon. it's not my birthday today. well, you'll come, won't you?

person beta:
sure, i will. thank you for inviting me.

person alpha:
my pleasure.

person beta:
do you have a minute?

person alpha:
sure. what's up?

person beta:
hey, may, look, is that the the poster of the movie we saw yesterday?

person alpha:
yes, that's right. that's the poster of the the witch.

person beta:
may, i really regret watching it with you last night.

person alpha:
did it scare you?

person beta:
of course not. i just thought the movie was... boring.

person alpha:
boring? come on, you clutched to my arm all the time.

person beta:
well, i admit. the ghosts were scary.

person alpha:
i like scary movies.

person beta:
that's gucci's influence. i love science fiction movies!

person alpha:
of course you do. they are silly stories just for little kids like you.

person beta:
don't call me kid. i am a grownup.

person alpha:
do you dare watch scary movies with me tonight?

person beta:
of course! i can watch them without you!

person alpha:
oh, really?

person beta:
what is your nationality?

person alpha:
i am chinese by birth.

person beta:
where is your domicile place?

person alpha:
my domicile place is hebes province.

person beta:
i know you have a son. how old is he?

person alpha:
he's going to turn six next month.

person beta:
who is looking after him?

person alpha:
my mother-in- law. she retired last year.

person beta:
you really are lucky!

person alpha:
yeah, i know.

person beta:
say, what's your favorite sport?

person alpha:
mmmm... it's hard to say. i like golf a lot-but i guess i like tennis better.

person beta:
do you play much tennis?

person alpha:
yes, quite a bit. how about a game sometime?

person beta:
sorry. i'm strictly a spectator-football, baseball, basketball, golf... i watch them all.

person alpha:
so janet, do you do any sports?

person beta:
well, i go to the gym a lot. i am a member of a gym nearby.

person alpha:
yeah, how often do you go?

person beta:
about three times a week if i can.

person alpha:
not bad! do you do any other sports?

person beta:
not really. i'd really like to try golf, though.

person alpha:
hello, ken.

person beta:
hello, george.

person alpha:
have you just been to the cinema?

person beta:
yes, i have.

person alpha:
what's on?

person beta:
paris in the spring.

person alpha:
oh, i've already seen it. i saw it on television last year. it's an old film, but it's very good.

person beta:
paris is a beautiful city. i have never been there. have you ever been there, ken?

person alpha:
yes, i have. i was there in april.

person beta:
paris in the spring, eh?

person alpha:
it was spring, but the weather was awful. it rained all the time.

person beta:
just like dear old london!

person alpha:
they got a divorce at last.

person beta:
it's inevitable. their love wasbuilt on the sand, and this is why their marriage has landed on the rocks.

person alpha:
you said it. love but on the sand will soon be on the rocks.

person beta:
that give us a good lesson.

person alpha:
where are you going?

person beta:
i'll accompany my wife to the hospital.

person alpha:
what's wrong with her.

person beta:
she is expecting.

person alpha:
congratulations to you.

person beta:
thank you.

person alpha:
i can't stand being with you anymore. i'm sick of your drinking.

person beta:
i swear never to drink again. just give me another chance, please!

person alpha:
how many chances have i given you? i don't trust you any more.

person beta:
you know how hard i've tried to give up drinking? i'd be lost without you. i won't let you go anyway.

person alpha:
are there any interesting stories in the newspaper today?

person beta:
there are a few stories about natural disasters. there is a massive forest fire in australia. it covers several square kilometers of land has destroyed many more square kilometers.

person alpha:
was it caused accidentally or naturally? sometimes it gets so hot that fires begin naturally in australia and africa.

person beta:
nobody knows at the moment, but it has been very hot there recently. the drought in africa is causing starvation. millions of people have migrated to try and find food.

person alpha:
what is the international community doing to help?

person beta:
the european union has sent several plants with relief supplies. several countries have sent soldiers to distribute food and medical supplies. refugee camps have been set up across the region.

person alpha:
how many countries have been affected?

person beta:
six have been seriously affected, but the refugees are also migrating to several surrounding countries.

person alpha:
i saw on the tv yesterday that there has been another earthquake in iran.

person beta:
yes. there have been a few there recently. they say that this one was not a big quake. the iranians are dealing with it on their own. they have purchased some special equipment to find people buried u

person alpha:
does the newspaper say anything about casualties?

person beta:
so far, less than 20 people have died, but over 100 are in hospital.

person alpha:
is this a photo of your family?

person beta:
yes, it is.it was taken just before i was leaving for college.

person alpha:
you look so lovely.

person beta:
how time flies! i'll not see twenty again.

person alpha:
i heard you've found a new job.

person beta:
yes, i'm now working in a company.

person alpha:
so you're quite happy with your new job?

person beta:
right. i enjoy what i'm doing.

person alpha:
would you come to spend the weekend with us?

person beta:
oh, i'm afraid i can't. i've had a date already.

person alpha:
that's too bad.

person beta:
may be some other time.

person alpha:
you received a letter in the mail.

person beta:
give it here.

person alpha:
who's the letter from?

person beta:
i think it's my acceptance letter from nyu.

person alpha:
i want to know what it says.

person beta:
they didn't accept me.

person alpha:
are you serious?

person beta:
it's the truth.

person alpha:
are you okay?

person beta:
i really wanted to get into nyu.

person alpha:
i am really sorry to hear that.

person beta:
it's okay. i'm still waiting to hear from ucla anyway.

person alpha:
why are you so quiet?

person beta:
my girlfriend just broke up with me.

person alpha:
you must feel terrible now.

person beta:
yeah.

person alpha:
i remember my first break up. it was the worst feeling in the world. i was crying everyday for three months. and slowly, it got better. i know you'll feel better too.

person beta:
you've been through this too?

person alpha:
yeah. i remember it very clearly. the pain makes it easy to remember. i know you're really hurting right now, but you know many people experience break ups.

person beta:
but it hurts too much.

person alpha:
i know it's painful, but it's only temporary. after the pain goes away, you'll find other girls.

person beta:
what if i don't want to find another girl?

person alpha:
you'll change your mind. look at everyone in the world. they all break up and move on. the faster you understand this, the quicker you will recover.

person beta:
you're right.

person alpha:
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her, but try to think of all the bad things. you know she didn't treat you that well. is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with?

person beta:
yeah. thanks for the talk.

person alpha:
i'll give you a call later. we should hang out. it's good to be around people.

person beta:
ok. i'll talk to you later.

person alpha:
excuse me, what do you want for this bag?

person beta:
let me see. the one goes for$ 17.

person alpha:
would you take$ 12?

person beta:
no, i can't let you have it for 12.how about 14?

person alpha:
13.50?

person beta:
sorry,$ 14 is the lowest i can go.

person alpha:
i'm afraid i spoke in all of the table clock.

person beta:
never mind about that.

person alpha:
i'm terribly sorry, won't you let me pay for?

person beta:
no, i won't hear of it.

person alpha:
a:: mr clinton, it's nice to see you again.

person beta:
nice to see you again, too. peter. how's your family?

person alpha:
a:: very well. how's mrs clinton?

person beta:
not bad, but she's as busy as before.

person alpha:
whatever we do, we should do it above board.

person beta:
you are right. we shouldn't do anything under the table.

person alpha:
well, since you agree with me, we should put the issue above board instead of talking about through other channels.

person beta:
morning, zina. just wanted to say thanks again!

person alpha:
hi, vince. thanks for stopping by. how's the work coming along for the online auction?

person beta:
oh, yeah. i'm glad you mentioned that. i think we need to hire somebody new to manage it.

person alpha:
can't elvin handle it?

person beta:
i think he's got too much on his plate.

person alpha:
this is the best dinner i've ever had.

person beta:
how about the soup?

person alpha:
i've never tasted anything better.

person beta:
how nice of you to say so.

person alpha:
hey nick, what are you up to?

person beta:
not much, just heading over to the shooting range. you wanna come?

person alpha:
seriously? you mean to fire a real weapon? i don't know man.

person beta:
yeah, it will be fun! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot. i also have a revolver that's really fun too! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim.

person alpha:
yeah that would be cool! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile! or what about a flame thrower!

person beta:
whoa, take it easy there rambo. don't get carried away. these weapons are not toys, and you must first learn how to handle them properly. there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe. for example, never handle a weapon that you haven't inspected yourself. always make sure there isn't anything in the chamber, and never put your finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot!

person alpha:
wow, i didn't know! it always looks so cool and easy in the movies!

person beta:
the reality is different you know, running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies! so are you ready?

person alpha:
let's do it!

person beta:
hi, jim. how are you? i haven't seen you for a while.

person alpha:
i'm fine. i've been out of town. i just got back.

person beta:
where were you?

person alpha:
i was in new york for a wedding.

person beta:
broadway mall is having a big sale this weekend. you wanna go?

person alpha:
don't feel like it. i'm broke.

person beta:
well, we can still do some window shopping, can't we?

person alpha:
just look around? ah, that's boring.

person beta:
i'll go myself then.

person alpha:
what's the problem, nada? you look down in the dumps.

person beta:
i don't know. my life is a big mess. everything is so complicated.

person alpha:
come on, nothing can be that bad.

person beta:
but promise me, you'll keep it a secret.

person alpha:
ok, i promise. so what's troubling you so much?

person beta:
i've fallen in love with my boss.

person alpha:
really? is he married?

person beta:
no, of course not. he is still single.

person alpha:
then what's your problem?

person beta:
i try to keep it to myself. but there is a lot of gossip about us.

person alpha:
oh, i see. office romance tends to be the subject of gossip.

person beta:
worse still, he is trying to avoid me these days.

person alpha:
office romance is very tricky.

person beta:
it gives me a lot of pressure and i feel depressed.

person alpha:
cheer up, nada. you'll be fine.

person beta:
you're not looking happy. what's the matter?

person alpha:
oh, nothing special. i'm just a bit tired.

person beta:
with the job?

person alpha:
with everything, with everybody, with all this!

person beta:
a good suggestion for you. you need a holiday.

person alpha:
it wasn't always like this, you know.

person beta:
what do you mean?

person alpha:
well, i mean. we always do the same thing. there's no variety in our lives.

person beta:
you need a holiday. that's what's the matter.

person alpha:
certainly, perhaps.

person beta:
i wonder what he looks like. oh, i can't wait to see him! his email said he'd be wearing a white hat.( looking around for him) oh, there is.

person alpha:
hey, isabelle...

person beta:
logan! why on earth are you hiding here? white hat! come on! don't tell me you're the guy! it can't be true.

person alpha:
yes, i am the guy.

person beta:
what a bummer! you set me up?

person alpha:
let me explain. i didn't mean to hurt you...

person beta:
how dare you!( starts to walk off)

person alpha:
hang on one second. hear me out, just this once, isabella!

person beta:
why did you lie to me in the email?

person alpha:
i didn't lie. you just didn't ask me my real name.

person beta:
i should have known it was you. no wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly. i thought i might have found the one for me.

person alpha:
i'm sorry. it was cruel of me. but i promise it will never happen again? look, there's a nice restaurant. let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over.

person beta:
peter, how often do you exercise?

person alpha:
well, i swim and run every day.

person beta:
now, tell me, what do you eat?

person alpha:
well, i don't eat any meat, but i do eat fish and eggs.

person beta:
do you eat a lot of vegetables?

person alpha:
oh yes, and fruit, i love fruit.

person beta:
what do you drink?

person alpha:
well, i never drink alcohol, coffee or tea. they are very bad for you.

person beta:
what do you drink?

person alpha:
did you watch the volleyball match last night?

person beta:
yeah.

person alpha:
who won?

person beta:
china.

person alpha:
what was the score?

person beta:
china beat brazil 3 to 0.

person alpha:
wonderful!

person beta:
even if our company didn't have a dress code, i still think people would wear formal clothing to work.

person alpha:
i wouldn't be so sure... people want to wear what they feel most comfortable in.

person beta:
maybe that's true for some positions, but i think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree. they dress for success! you can't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans. it's just not respectful to you client.

person alpha:
i think what you wear is so overrated. i would rather have a down-to-earth, honest and solid sales person than a painted, patent leather, designer suite salesman.

person beta:
it's not as simple as that. people judge you by your appearance, whether you like it or not. so dressing professional is being professional. the image that you portray to others is so important in business. it's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale.

person alpha:
maybe you're right, but i'll take my sneakers and jeans any day!

person beta:
isn't it wonderful walking here?

person alpha:
what do you mean?

person beta:
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us.

person alpha:
yes, look over there. that's the empire state building. my book says it's 102 stories tall.

person beta:
it's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned?

person alpha:
you're right, but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering.

person beta:
what other important buildings are we going to see on fifth avenue?

person alpha:
quite a number. actually every skyscraper has a history. a few blocks ahead we'll see st.patrick's cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed rockefeller center. it's a landmark in the history of architecture.

person beta:
what's there after that?

person alpha:
well then, there's a central park. facing the park on fifth avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world.

person beta:
what are they all for?

person alpha:
most of them are office buildings, huge department stores, and hotels but some are just private homes. new york is one of the financial centers of the world. and there are lots of very expensive places.

person beta:
hey kevin, what are you doing here? don't you usually spend tuesday nights at home studying?

person alpha:
i needed to get out of the house. my parents just went ballistic over something my older sister told them.

person beta:
what did she tell them? is she dropping out of college?

person alpha:
nothing that serious. she finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend.

person beta:
and your parents took it badly?

person alpha:
that's putting it mildly. my father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her.

person beta:
ouch, that sounds bad. what did your sister do?

person alpha:
she started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend, how they're in love and it's not hurting anybody, and so on. my dad said she's too young to do this, and that she should move out right away.

person beta:
how long has your sister been with her boyfriend?

person alpha:
three years. they've been dating since freshman year. they're even talking about marriage.

person beta:
really? then i guess living together would be a good idea.

person alpha:
what do you mean?

person beta:
well, these days too many people are getting divorced. if they live together, then at least they're finding out if they're really compatible or not.

person alpha:
i guess so. better to find out now than after you're married, when it's harder to get out.

person beta:
do you think they two will get married?

person alpha:
yeah, you can count on it.

person beta:
i think so. yes, they get along so well.

person alpha:
i like him. he's good for her.

person beta:
you're right. he sure is.

person alpha:
what do you think of frank?

person beta:
he is all right. but i think he seems to have no back bone.

person alpha:
why do you say that?

person beta:
whatever things get tough, he gives in.

person alpha:
uh-oh. we don't have a flashlight.

person beta:
don't worry. we'll make it back to the camp site before dark.

person alpha:
i sure hope so.

person beta:
do you speak only english in the class, or does your teacher explain everything to you in spanish?

person alpha:
oh, we never speak spanish in class! miss.parker speaks to us only in english.

person beta:
i suppose she's right. does she speak english very slowly?

person alpha:
not always. sometimes we don't understand her. then she has to repeat what she said.

person beta:
it must be interesting to study english.

person alpha:
mario and i are the best students in the class. miss.parker says that my pronunciation is very good.

person beta:
is english pronunciation easy or difficult?

person alpha:
sometimes it's difficult. some words look different from the way one pronounces them.

person beta:
it's quiet everywhere in winter.

person alpha:
yes. i like winter.

person beta:
me too.

person alpha:
it's snowing heavily. what about taking a walk?

person beta:
that's a good idea. let's go!

person alpha:
what a heavy snow! look! the water is frozen.

person beta:
take care! don't slip on the ground.

person alpha:
i've got it. i like the feeling of stepping on the ice.

person beta:
yes. very wonderful.

person alpha:
there is a snowman over there.

person beta:
how lovely it is!

person alpha:
tim's always bothering me.

person beta:
just tell him off.

person alpha:
who are those guys?

person beta:
kobe bryant and shaquille o'neal, they are the los angeles lakers'star players.

person alpha:
oh.

person beta:
wait a second. he shoots, he scores!

person alpha:
all right!

person beta:
here comes jordan, though.

person alpha:
wow, michael jordan's slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch.

person beta:
yeah. he's older, so he doesn't slam as much as he did when he was younger, but when he does, it's still amazing.

person alpha:
which team do you think will win?

person beta:
the lakers. jordan is the only good player washington has.

person alpha:
i am sorry to trouble you again, mr.stone.

person beta:
it's ok. what do you want to ask?

person alpha:
where should i go after i arrived at the university?

person beta:
the first place you should go is the international center.

person alpha:
why?

person beta:
you can get help there in dealing with the united states immigration and naturalization service; you can find foreign student advisers.

person alpha:
what kind of role do foreign student advisers play?

person beta:
they'll discuss personal concerns, housing, adjustment, finances and other matters with you.

person alpha:
can we get any more help at the international center?

person beta:
yes, a lot more. if you go there just before the beginning of the fall's semester, you can get your student id and social security number there. they will keep your documents up-to-date. they will offer an orientation program for new comers. they will also help you contact your department and registration office.

person alpha:
i see. it must be worth going to.

person beta:
besides these, the center staff also works with community organizations which provide tours, home hospitality, speaking engagements and assistance for wives of foreign students. in cooperation with nationality clubs, student associations and other organizations, the international center provides a varied program of cultural and social events throughout the year.

person alpha:
wonderful. it is a home for foreign students.

person beta:
it sure is. they also serve tea, coffee and refreshments. the center staff members are also friendly and helpful. everyone loves them.

person alpha:
hi, lander. what's wrong?

person beta:
i can hardly make ends meet these days.

person alpha:
same here. i have't brought any new clothes for three months.

person beta:
my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise.

person alpha:
true. the news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities.

person beta:
definitely. i have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month.

person alpha:
the biggest price jump is for pork, so most people have to turn to chicken.

person beta:
is that inflation?

person alpha:
inflation is more than just the rising prices, i guess. but the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation.

person beta:
has the government taken some measures to curb it?

person alpha:
yes. the government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy.

person beta:
but i'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy.

person alpha:
you said it. i think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending.

person beta:
how?

person alpha:
for a start, we can take the public transport to work. you know, running a car is a big expense.

person beta:
sounds a good idea.

person alpha:
ok, everyone. gather around. here are the rules. no tackling. no pushing.

person beta:
you shouldn't grab someone else's shirt. that's a foul.

person alpha:
play is stopped when the person with the ball is touched.

person beta:
you can touch them only between the shoulder and the knees.

person alpha:
the touchdown lines are there and there. ok, let's play!

person beta:
before we start, let's have a moment of silence for our fallen men.

person alpha:
have you adapted to the lifestyle in china?

person beta:
yeah, almost. but there is one thing.

person alpha:
what?

person beta:
i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people. i don't mean to say that there's no privacy in china, but...

person alpha:
what is it?

person beta:
some of my chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others.

person alpha:
that makes you feel uncomfortable?

person beta:
yeah. we never do that in a public office.

person alpha:
perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy.

person beta:
i have felt that. one day when i was in a queue, reading a newspaper story, the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper i was holding.

person alpha:
well, that's not rare. i've seen people reading at others'newspaper while taking a metro or a bus.

person beta:
just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him?

person alpha:
yeah.

person beta:
oh, i'm shocked.

person alpha:
what courses did you take in college?

person beta:
i took a lot of courses, such as philosophy, logic, ethics, aesthetics, etc.

person alpha:
which course did you like best?

person beta:
i liked aesthetics best. it is very impressive.

person alpha:
hi. have you got a personal computer?

person beta:
certainly. what's the matter?

person alpha:
i wonder if you often trade with others on the internet.

person beta:
sure. i often buy things or do business through it without going out to the physical stores.

person alpha:
great! it's just like viewless stores. but how can you shop or order on line or trade on line?

person beta:
that's simple. just click the hyperlink, www.taobao.com or www. ebay.com, and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen, and then you can place an order online with the sales company. and the goods will be delivered to your place.

person alpha:
is the service charged?

person beta:
no. it's free.

person alpha:
really. i'll get a computer at once.

person beta:
we are planning to go to beidaihe for vacation. do you want to go with us?

person alpha:
it's so cool!

person beta:
excuse me, is this seat taken?

person alpha:
i'm afraid this seat is taken.

person beta:
oh. is it. thank you anyway.

person alpha:
you're welcome. why don't you ask the conductor when he comes by?

person beta:
thank you.

person alpha:
i prefer potatoes to eggplants.

person beta:
i feel eggplants are more nutritious.

person alpha:
but as a matter of fact, potatoes taste better.

person beta:
oh, that's how you see it.

person alpha:
are you sure you can't lend me five thousand dollars?

person beta:
hmm... i'll tell you what. i'll lend you four thousand dollars, but you have to pay me back next week.

person alpha:
it's a deal.

person beta:
where do you plan to go this winter?

person alpha:
alps, suppose.

person beta:
oh, yes, you like skiing.

person alpha:
right.

person beta:
every time when heroes came back from the battlefield, we took our hats off to them.

person alpha:
you were showing respect and admiration for them.

person beta:
i wish i were a hero.

person alpha:
frank's getting married, do you believe this?

person beta:
is he really?

person alpha:
yes, he is. he loves the girl very much.

person beta:
who is he marring?

person alpha:
a girl he met on holiday in spain, i think.

person beta:
have they set a date for the wedding?

person alpha:
not yet.

person beta:
ok. come back into the classroom, class.

person alpha:
does the class start again, mam?

person beta:
yes, but to the heath, this break has long enough.

person alpha:
oh, breaktime flies.

person beta:
come on, baby. it's time now.

person alpha:
mam, another minute, could i?

person beta:
hurry up, little boy.

person alpha:
do you have any hobbies?

person beta:
yes, i like collecting things.

person alpha:
oh, that's interesting, and but what kind of things?

person beta:
several things, for example, very coins, stamps, stones and so on.

person alpha:
stones? i know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones?

person beta:
yes, stones.

person alpha:
well, i can't just imagine it.

person beta:
jenny, what's wrong with you? why do you keep weeping like that?

person alpha:
mary told me that she had seen you with john last night. i got to know the fact that you are playing the field.

person beta:
honey, cross my heart, i'v never looked at another woman since the first day i set my eyes on you! believe me, that's the truth.

person alpha:
what a nice day!

person beta:
yes. how about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass?

person alpha:
great, let's go!

person beta:
hey, darling, i think i might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day. i was so relaxed. it felt as if i were in another world.

person alpha:
exactly. you know, the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon. you remember? the island, the sound of the waves, the salty sea air and the sunshine...

person beta:
yes, it was wonderful but it's already been a year. how time flies!

person alpha:
why not go again to celebrate out one-year anniversary? we can go to the same beach, stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant.

person beta:
are you kidding? can you afford it? do you think we can get a room on such short notice?

person alpha:
never mind that, i'll take care of it. are you available next week?

person beta:
yeah, i think so.

person alpha:
ok. i'll make the arrangements. it will be great.

person beta:
wonderful! i'll start packing our suitcases.
