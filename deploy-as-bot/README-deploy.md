# deployment

Two methods of deployment are explored in this repo. A telegram bot, which has the downside of the user getting telegram (because not everyone has / wants it), and gradio, which is easier to access, but if disrupted the link changes and users would need to be informed.

_more deployment ideas / options to come_

## gradio

-   gradio allows you to deploy the model from your local computer and users essentially just need to open the link you send them in their browser
-   find out more [here](https://www.gradio.app/getting_started)

## telegram

-   Deploy the bot to telegram using the `python-telegram-bot` package
-   Test it by messaging @GPTPeter_bot on [telegram](https://telegram.org/)
